    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

The question asks: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?\"\n   - In logical form: Does (¬R → M) follow?\n\nNow let me trace through the logic:\n\nFrom statement 2, we know ¬H is true (home prices won't increase the most).\n\nFrom statement 1, we have: ¬H → (¬R → M)\n\nSince ¬H is true, and we have a conditional ¬H → (¬R → M), we can apply modus ponens:\n- We get: (¬R → M)\n\nThis is exactly what the question asks whether it follows.\n\nSo yes, from the given premises, we can validly derive that \"if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
