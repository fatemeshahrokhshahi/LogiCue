    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it’s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

The question asks: Does it follow that \"it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will\"?\n   This is asking: Does it follow that it's likely that (¬T → W)?\n\nNow, let's analyze:\n- We're told it's likely that T (tidal power generates the most)\n- We're told it's likely that ¬S (solar power doesn't generate the most)\n- We're given that ¬S → (¬T → W) is true\n\nThe question is whether \"it's likely that (¬T → W)\" follows.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that ¬S → (¬T → W) is logically true (a given fact).\n\nSince we're told it's likely that ¬S is true, and we know that whenever ¬S is true, the conditional (¬T → W) must be true, it follows that it's likely that (¬T → W) is true.\n\nIn other words: if ¬S is likely true, and ¬S logically entails (¬T → W), then (¬T → W) is likely true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
