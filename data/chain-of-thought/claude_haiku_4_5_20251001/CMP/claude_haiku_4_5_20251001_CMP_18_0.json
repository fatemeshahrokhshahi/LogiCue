    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

            "content": "Explanation:\n\nLet me work through this logical argument step by step.\n\nFirst, let me identify the key statements:\n1. Pizza likely will be the top takeout item\n2. Burgers likely will be second\n3. Tacos ordered much less frequently\n4. \"If burgers aren't the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn't, tacos will be\" - This is: ¬B → (¬P → T)\n5. \"Pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won't\" - This states: P is likely AND ¬B is likely\n\nNow, the question asks: Does it follow that \"if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be\"? This is asking: Does (¬P → T) follow?\n\nLet me analyze the logical structure:\n- Statement 4 says: ¬B → (¬P → T)\n- Statement 5 tells us that P is likely true AND ¬B is likely true\n\nIf ¬B is likely true (burgers likely won't be top), then from statement 4, we can derive (¬P → T).\n\nSo given that burgers likely won't be the top item (which statement 5 asserts), the conditional ¬B → (¬P → T) allows us to conclude (¬P → T).\n\nTherefore, it does follow that it's likely that if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
