    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny’s album doesn’t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift’s doesn’t, Beyonce’s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift’s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\n\nLet me work through this logical problem step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n- T = Taylor Swift's album sells the most\n- B = Bad Bunny's album sells the most\n- Y = Beyoncé's album sells the most\n\nGiven facts:\n1. \"If Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift's doesn't, Beyoncé's will\"\n   This translates to: ¬B → (¬T → Y)\n\n2. \"Taylor Swift's likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't\"\n   This means: It's likely that T, and therefore likely that ¬B\n\n3. The question asks: Does it follow that \"it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyoncé's will\"?\n   This is asking: Does it follow that it's likely that (¬T → Y)?\n\nNow, let me analyze:\n\nFrom fact 1: ¬B → (¬T → Y)\n\nFrom fact 2: It's likely that ¬B (since it's likely that T)\n\nIf ¬B is likely true, then by modus ponens on the conditional in fact 1, it's likely that (¬T → Y).\n\nHere's the key reasoning: We're told it's likely that ¬B. Given the conditional ¬B → (¬T → Y), if the antecedent (¬B) is likely true, then the consequent (¬T → Y) is also likely true.\n\nThis is a valid application of probabilistic reasoning: if we know that ¬B is likely, and we have a conditional that says ¬B implies (¬T → Y), then (¬T → Y) is likely.\n\nAnswer: yes",
