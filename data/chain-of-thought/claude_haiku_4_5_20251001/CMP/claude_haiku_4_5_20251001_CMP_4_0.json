    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?",

Diego is a longshot\n4. These are the only three candidates\n5. If Julian doesn't get it AND Priya doesn't get it, then Diego will get it\n6. It's likely that Priya will get the offer\n7. Therefore, it's likely that Julian won't get the offer\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will?\n\nLet me denote:\n- P(Priya gets offer) = high probability\n- P(Julian gets offer) = medium probability\n- P(Diego gets offer) = low probability\n\nFrom statement 6: It's likely Priya gets the offer, so P(Priya) is high.\n\nThe question asks about: P(Diego gets offer | Priya doesn't get offer)\n\nGiven that these are the only three candidates and exactly one will get the offer:\n- If Priya doesn't get the offer, then either Julian or Diego gets it\n- The conditional probability P(Diego | not Priya) depends on the relative likelihoods of Julian vs. Diego among the remaining candidates\n\nSince we're told Julian is more likely than Diego overall, and there's no information suggesting this relationship reverses when Priya is eliminated, we would expect Julian to still be more likely than Diego in the conditional scenario.\n\nTherefore, if Priya doesn't get the offer, it would be more likely that Julian gets it (not Diego). This means it would NOT be likely that Diego gets it under this condition.\n\nThe conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
