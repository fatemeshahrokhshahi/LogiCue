    "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren’t the top seller, then if banana bread isn’t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn’t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",

            "content": "Explanation:\n\nLet me work through this logical problem step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n- B = banana bread is top seller\n- C = chocolate chip cookies is top seller\n- R = carrot cake is top seller\n\nGiven information:\n1. It is very likely that B (banana bread will be top seller)\n2. C is likely to be second (chocolate chip cookies follow closely)\n3. These are the only top sellers, so: ¬C → (¬B → R)\n   This means: if cookies aren't top, then if bread isn't top, cake will be\n4. It is likely that B, and hence likely that ¬C\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that it is likely that (¬B → R)?\nIn other words: Does it follow that it is likely that if banana bread isn't top, carrot cake will be?\n\nLet me analyze this:\n\nFrom statement 3, we have the logical truth: ¬C → (¬B → R)\nThis is a tautology given the constraint that only one can be top seller.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know:\n- It is likely that B (so likely that ¬¬B, meaning likely that B is true)\n- It is likely that ¬C (cookies won't be top)\n\nNow, the question is whether \"it is likely that (¬B → R)\" follows.\n\nThe conditional ¬B → R is logically entailed by ¬C (from statement 3). Since we're told it's likely that ¬C, and ¬C logically entails ¬B → R, it does follow that it is likely that ¬B → R.\n\nIn other words: Given that it's likely chocolate chip cookies won't be top, and given that if cookies aren't top then (if bread isn't top, cake will be), it follows that it's likely that if bread isn't top, cake will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
