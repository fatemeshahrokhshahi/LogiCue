    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it’s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be. Moreover, it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "Explanation:\n\nLet me work through this logical problem step by step.\n\nGiven information:\n1. It's likely apples will be top, followed by bananas, with oranges trailing\n2. These are the top three fruits (only ones we're considering)\n3. \"If bananas aren't top, then if apples aren't, oranges will be\" - this is a logical statement\n4. \"It's likely apples will be top and hence bananas won't be\" - this tells us it's likely apples is top\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that \"it is likely that, if apples aren't top, oranges will be\"?\n\nLet me denote:\n- A = apples is top\n- B = bananas is top\n- O = oranges is top\n\nGiven statement 3 says: ¬B → (¬A → O), which is logically equivalent to: (B ∨ ¬A ∨ O)\n\nWe're told it's likely that A is true (and hence ¬B is likely).\n\nThe question asks whether it's likely that: ¬A → O\n\nNow, the key insight: We're told it's LIKELY that A is true. This means scenarios where ¬A is true are relatively unlikely. \n\nWhen we ask \"is it likely that IF ¬A THEN O?\", we're asking about the conditional probability or likelihood in the subset of scenarios where ¬A holds.\n\nGiven the constraint that ¬B → (¬A → O) must hold, whenever ¬A is true, we need either B or O to be true. But we're told it's likely that A is true, so ¬A scenarios are rare. In those rare ¬A scenarios, the constraint forces either B or O. Since we're told B is unlikely (because A is likely), in the ¬A scenarios, O would need to be true to satisfy the constraint.\n\nTherefore, conditional on ¬A being true (the rare case), O is very likely to be true, making the conditional \"if ¬A then O\" likely to hold.\n\nAnswer: yes",
