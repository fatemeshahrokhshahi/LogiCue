    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn’t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn’t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn’t lead in sales, Honda will?",

Industry analysis expects Ford #1, Toyota #2, Honda #3 (with Honda lagging significantly)\n2. \"If Toyota isn't #1, then if Ford isn't #1, Honda will be\" - This is: ¬T → (¬F → H)\n3. \"Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won't\" - This establishes that Ford likely #1 and Toyota likely not #1\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that \"it is likely that, if Ford doesn't lead in sales, Honda will\"?\nThis is asking: Does it follow that it is likely that (¬F → H)?\n\nLet me analyze the logical structure:\n- Statement 2 gives us: ¬T → (¬F → H) as a logical fact\n- Statement 3 tells us: It is likely that F (Ford leads) and likely that ¬T (Toyota doesn't lead)\n\nNow, the key issue: From \"it is likely that ¬T\" and the logical rule \"¬T → (¬F → H)\", can we conclude \"it is likely that (¬F → H)\"?\n\nIf ¬T is likely true, then by modus ponens on the rule ¬T → (¬F → H), we can conclude that (¬F → H) is likely true.\n\nThis is a valid inference: if the antecedent of a conditional is likely true, and we have that conditional as a logical rule, then the consequent is likely true.\n\nSince statement 3 establishes that it is likely that ¬T (Toyota won't lead), and statement 2 establishes that ¬T → (¬F → H), it follows that it is likely that (¬F → H).\n\nAnswer: yes",
