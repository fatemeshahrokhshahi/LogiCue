    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

            "content": "Explanation:\n\nLet me work through this logical argument step by step.\n\nFirst, let me identify the key statements:\n1. India's economy will likely grow fastest this year\n2. China's will likely grow second fastest\n3. Russia's will likely grow slowest\n4. These are the three biggest emerging economies\n5. \"If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn't, Russia will be\" (given as a logical principle)\n6. \"India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't\" (stated as a conclusion from the premises)\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that \"it's likely that, if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be\"?\n\nLet me parse the logical structure:\n- Statement 5 says: ¬C → (¬I → R), which is logically equivalent to: (C ∨ ¬I ∨ R)\n- This means: Either China is top-growing, OR India isn't top-growing, OR Russia is top-growing (or some combination)\n\nNow, the premises tell us it's likely that India IS the top-growing economy (statement 1 and 6).\n\nIf India IS the top-growing economy (I is true), then:\n- The conditional \"if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be\" (¬I → R) is vacuously true, because its antecedent is false\n- A conditional with a false antecedent is always true\n\nHowever, the question asks whether it's *likely* that this conditional holds. Since we're told it's likely that India WILL be the top-growing economy, the antecedent of the conditional (¬I) is unlikely to be true. This makes the conditional vacuously true in the likely scenario.\n\nBut the logical principle given (statement 5) already establishes that this conditional must hold as a matter of logical necessity (given the three-economy constraint). So yes, it does follow that the conditional holds—in fact, it must hold regardless of which economy actually grows fastest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
