            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\nIn logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"griffin was in the forest\" and Q = \"unicorn was in the forest\")\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\nIn logical form: If not Q, then not P\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the original statement. A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTo verify: If we assume the original statement is true and the unicorn was NOT in the forest, then by modus tollens (the logical rule that allows us to infer \"not P\" from \"not Q\" when we have \"If P then Q\"), the griffin must NOT have been in the forest. This confirms the contrapositive is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
