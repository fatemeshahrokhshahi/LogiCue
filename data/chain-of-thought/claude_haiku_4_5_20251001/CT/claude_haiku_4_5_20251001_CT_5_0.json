            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\"\nIn logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q = \"Amy played tennis\")\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\nSo the contrapositive would be: \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\"\n\nA fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. If the original is false, the contrapositive must also be false.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
