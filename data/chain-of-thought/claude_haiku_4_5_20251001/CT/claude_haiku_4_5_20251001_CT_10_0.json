            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\"\nIn logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"dog was inside\" and Q = \"cat was outside\")\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\"\nIn logical form: If not Q, then not P\n\nThis is the definition of the contrapositive. A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
