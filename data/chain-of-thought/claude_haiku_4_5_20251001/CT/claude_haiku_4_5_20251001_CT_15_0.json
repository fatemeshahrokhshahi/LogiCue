            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\"\nIn logical form: P → Q (where P = \"Sam took a plane\" and Q = \"Erin took a train\")\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\"\nIn logical form: ¬Q → ¬P (where ¬Q = \"Erin did not take a train\" and ¬P = \"Sam did not take a plane\")\n\nThis proposed inference is the contrapositive of the original statement. A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
