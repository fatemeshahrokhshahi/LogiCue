            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\nIn logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"written by James\" and Q = \"is a mystery novel\")\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\nIn logical form: If not Q, then not P\n\nThis is the definition of the contrapositive. A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
