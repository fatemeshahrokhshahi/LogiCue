            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\"\nIn logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q = \"Bob chose pasta\")\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\nSo the contrapositive would be: \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\"\n\nA fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
