            "content": "Explanation: This question asks about the logical relationship between a conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\nIn logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"apple was red\" and Q = \"banana was yellow\")\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\"\nIn logical form: If not Q, then not P\n\nThis second statement is the contrapositive of the original statement. A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
