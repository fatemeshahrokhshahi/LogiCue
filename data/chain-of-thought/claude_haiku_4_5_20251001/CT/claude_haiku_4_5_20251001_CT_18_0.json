            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\nIn logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"doll was plastic\" and Q = \"truck was metal\")\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\"\nIn logical form: If not Q, then not P\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the original statement. A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
