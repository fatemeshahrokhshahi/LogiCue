            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\"\nIn logical form: If A, then C (or A → C)\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\"\nIn logical form: If not C, then not A (or ¬C → ¬A)\n\nThe statement \"If not C, then not A\" is the contrapositive of \"If A, then C.\"\n\nA fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
