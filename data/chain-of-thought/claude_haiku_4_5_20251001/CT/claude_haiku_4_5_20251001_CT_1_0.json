            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical inference step by step.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\nIn logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q = \"Sue was at the wedding\")\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\nIn logical form: If not Q, then not P\n\nThis is asking whether we can infer the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn formal logic, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value.\n\nTo verify: If the original statement is true, then whenever P is true, Q must be true. This means if Q is false, P cannot be true (otherwise we'd have P true and Q false, contradicting the original statement). Therefore, if Q is false, P must be false.\n\nThis is a valid logical inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
