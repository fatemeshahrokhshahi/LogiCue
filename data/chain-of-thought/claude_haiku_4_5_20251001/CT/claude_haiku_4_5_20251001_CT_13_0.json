            "content": "Explanation: This question asks about the logical relationship between a conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\nIn logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"car was red\" and Q = \"truck was blue\")\n\nThe statement in question is: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\"\nIn logical form: If not Q, then not P\n\nThis is the definition of the contrapositive of a conditional statement. A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value.\n\nIf \"If P, then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q, then not P\" must also be true.\n\nThis can be verified through reasoning: If we know that whenever the car is red, the truck must be blue, then logically, if the truck is not blue, the car cannot have been red (otherwise the truck would have to be blue, which contradicts our observation).\n\nAnswer: yes",
