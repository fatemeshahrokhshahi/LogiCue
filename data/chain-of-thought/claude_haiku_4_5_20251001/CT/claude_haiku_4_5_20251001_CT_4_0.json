            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nLet me denote:\n- P = \"the alien visited Mars\"\n- Q = \"the robot visited Jupiter\"\n\nThe original statement is: \"If P, then Q\" (P → Q)\n\nThe statement we're asked about is: \"If not Q, then not P\" (¬Q → ¬P)\n\nThis is the definition of the contrapositive. A fundamental logical principle is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value.\n\nIn other words, if \"If P then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q then not P\" must also be true.\n\nThis is a valid inference rule in classical logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
