            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can derive one conditional statement from another. Let me analyze the logical relationship.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\nIn logical form: P → Q (where P = \"Joe went to the park\" and Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo\")\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\"\nIn logical form: ¬Q → ¬P (where ¬Q = \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" and ¬P = \"Joe did not go to the park\")\n\nThis is a fundamental principle of logic called the **contrapositive**. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (P → Q) is logically equivalent to the original statement (¬Q → ¬P). This means they always have the same truth value.\n\nIf the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. If the original statement is false, the contrapositive must also be false.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can validly infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
