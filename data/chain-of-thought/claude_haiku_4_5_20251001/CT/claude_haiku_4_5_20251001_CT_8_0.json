            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\nIn logical form: If P, then Q (where P = vampire awake, Q = mummy awake)\n\nThe statement we're asked about is: \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\nIn logical form: If not Q, then not P\n\nThis second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement. A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTo verify: If we assume the mummy was not awake, and we know that \"if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" then the vampire cannot have been awake (because if it were, the mummy would have to be awake, which contradicts our assumption). Therefore, the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
