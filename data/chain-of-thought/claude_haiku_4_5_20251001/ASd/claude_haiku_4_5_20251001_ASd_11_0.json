            "content": "Explanation: Let me analyze this logical inference step by step.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" \nThis can be written as: Sleep → ¬Tired\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\"\nThis can be written as: (Sleep ∧ HardLabor) → ¬Tired\n\nTo determine if we can validly infer the second from the first, I need to check if the second logically follows from the first.\n\nFrom \"Sleep → ¬Tired,\" we know that getting enough sleep is sufficient to prevent tiredness. However, this tells us nothing about what happens when we combine sleep with hard labor. \n\nThe original statement doesn't address scenarios where additional factors (like hard labor) are introduced. Hard labor could make someone tired regardless of whether they got enough sleep. The original premise only guarantees that sleep alone prevents tiredness—it doesn't guarantee that sleep combined with hard labor prevents tiredness.\n\nThis is a logical fallacy. We cannot validly add additional conditions to the antecedent (the \"if\" part) and expect the consequent (the \"then\" part) to remain unchanged. Adding \"and do hard labor\" introduces a new variable that could change the outcome.\n\nAnswer: no",
