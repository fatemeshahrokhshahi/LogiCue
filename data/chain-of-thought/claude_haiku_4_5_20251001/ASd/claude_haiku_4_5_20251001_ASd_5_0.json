However, it says nothing about what happens when additional conditions are added to the antecedent. \n\nIf we add the condition \"and the check bounces\" to create (P ∧ B), we're creating a more restrictive condition. The original rule doesn't tell us what happens in this new scenario. In fact, it's reasonable to think that if a check bounces, the bill might not actually be paid (or might be considered unpaid), which could contradict the original condition.\n\nWe cannot validly infer (P ∧ B) → S from P → S alone, because the original statement provides no information about cases where the check bounces.\n\nAnswer: no",
