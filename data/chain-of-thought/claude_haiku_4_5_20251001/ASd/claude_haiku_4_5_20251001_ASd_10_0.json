            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical inference step by step.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the order is placed, then the item will ship\"\nIn logical form: P → S (where P = order is placed, S = item will ship)\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the order is placed AND the item is out of stock, then it will ship\"\nIn logical form: (P ∧ O) → S (where O = item is out of stock)\n\nTo determine if we can validly infer the second statement from the first, I need to consider whether (P ∧ O) → S logically follows from P → S.\n\nFrom P → S, we know that whenever P is true, S must be true. However, this tells us nothing about what happens when additional conditions are added to the antecedent. Specifically, knowing that \"if P then S\" does not tell us what happens when both P and O are true.\n\nIn fact, it's entirely possible that:\n- When only P is true (and O is false), S is true\n- When both P and O are true, S is false (because the item being out of stock would prevent shipping)\n\nThis shows the inference is invalid. We cannot conclude that adding an additional condition (the item being out of stock) to the antecedent would preserve the consequent.\n\nAnswer: no",
