            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical inference step by step.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the match is struck, then it will light\"\nIn logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"match is struck\" and Q = \"it will light\")\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the match is struck AND it has been soaked in water, then it will light\"\nIn logical form: If (P AND R), then Q (where R = \"it has been soaked in water\")\n\nTo determine if we can validly infer the second statement from the first, I need to consider whether (P AND R) → Q logically follows from P → Q.\n\nThe answer is no. Here's why:\n\nFrom P → Q, we know that whenever P is true, Q must be true. However, this tells us nothing about what happens when additional conditions are added to the antecedent. \n\nIn fact, adding a conjunct to the antecedent (the \"if\" part) can change the truth conditions. If a match is soaked in water, it may no longer light even if struck—the additional condition R could prevent Q from being true.\n\nThe original statement P → Q does not guarantee that (P AND R) → Q. The water-soaking condition could be a defeating condition that prevents the match from lighting.\n\nAnswer: no",
