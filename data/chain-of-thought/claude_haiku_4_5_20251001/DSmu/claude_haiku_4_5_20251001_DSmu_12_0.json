When we have a disjunction (OR statement) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false, we can validly conclude that the other disjunct must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n- We're told it's either in one place or the other\n- We're told it's NOT in the closet\n- Therefore, it must be draped over the chair\n\nThis is a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
