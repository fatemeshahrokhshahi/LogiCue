            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical inference step by step.\n\nWe have two premises:\n1. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" - This is a disjunction: (Fido is inside) OR (Fido must be in the garden)\n2. \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" - This negates the second disjunct: NOT(Fido must be in the garden)\n\nThis is a classic application of the disjunctive syllogism (also called modus tollendo ponens), which has the valid form:\n- (P OR Q)\n- NOT Q\n- Therefore, P\n\nApplying this form:\n- (Fido is inside OR Fido must be in the garden)\n- NOT(Fido must be in the garden)\n- Therefore, Fido is inside\n\nSince we have a disjunction and we've eliminated one of the disjuncts as false, the other disjunct must be true. This is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
