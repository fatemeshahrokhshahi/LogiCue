            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical inference problem involving disjunction (OR) and negation.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf OR it must be resting on the table\" = (A OR B)\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" = NOT B\n- Question: Can we infer \"The book is on the shelf\" = A?\n\nThis is the logical form known as disjunctive syllogism (also called modus tollendo ponens):\n- If (A OR B) is true\n- And NOT B is true\n- Then A must be true\n\nHere's why this works: If we have a disjunction (A OR B), it means at least one of the two options must be true. If we then learn that B is false (NOT B), the only way for the disjunction to remain true is if A must be true.\n\nIn this case:\n- We know the book is either on the shelf or on the table\n- We know it's NOT on the table\n- Therefore, it must be on the shelf\n\nThis is a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
