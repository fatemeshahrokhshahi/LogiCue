The second premise says \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" - this is a negation of the modal claim \"must be on my desk.\"\n\nIf we interpret this as simply denying that Q is true (¬Q), then by disjunctive syllogism from (P ∨ Q) and ¬Q, we can validly infer P.\n\nHowever, there's a subtle issue: the negation of \"must be on my desk\" could mean either:\n- \"It's not necessary that it's on my desk\" (¬□Q)\n- \"It's not the case that it's on my desk\" (¬Q)\n\nIf we take the straightforward reading where the second premise simply denies the consequent of the disjunction, then we have a valid disjunctive syllogism: from (P ∨ Q) and ¬Q, we can infer P.\n\nAnswer: yes",
