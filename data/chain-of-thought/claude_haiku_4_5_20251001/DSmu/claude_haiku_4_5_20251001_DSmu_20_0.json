            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical inference step by step.\n\nWe have:\n1. \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" - This is a disjunction (A or B)\n2. \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" - This negates the second disjunct (not B)\n\nIn classical logic, when we have a disjunction (A or B) and we know that one disjunct is false (not B), we can validly conclude that the other disjunct must be true (A). This is the logical rule called \"disjunctive syllogism.\"\n\nApplying this:\n- Premise 1 gives us: (Sunglasses in bag) OR (Sunglasses on head)\n- Premise 2 gives us: NOT (Sunglasses on head)\n- Therefore: (Sunglasses in bag)\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
