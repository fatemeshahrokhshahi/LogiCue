            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical reasoning step by step.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\nThis can be written as: If P, then Q (where P = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q = \"Mark bought the blue shirt\")\n\nThe second statement is: \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\"\nThis means it's possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, or equivalently, we cannot be certain that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, the question asks if we can infer: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nFrom classical logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (or definitely did not happen), then we can conclude P is false. This is called modus tollens.\n\nHowever, the second statement only says Mark \"might not have\" bought the blue shirt—meaning it's possible he didn't, not that he definitely didn't. This is weaker than saying \"Mark definitely did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nIf we only know that Q is possibly false (not necessarily false), we cannot definitively apply modus tollens. We can only say that it's possible Lisa did not buy the red shirt, not that she definitely did not.\n\nTo infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" with certainty, we would need to know for certain that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
