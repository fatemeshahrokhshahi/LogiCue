It only says it's possible or uncertain. To use the contrapositive to conclude ¬P, we would need to know for certain that ¬Q is true.\n\nSince we only know that ¬Q is possible (not certain), we cannot definitively infer that Ben did not eat pasta. We can only say it's possible that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
