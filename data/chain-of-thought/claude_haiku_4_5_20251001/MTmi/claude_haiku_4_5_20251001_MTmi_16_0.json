            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical reasoning step by step.\n\nThe first statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\"\nThis can be written as: Cotton → Denim\n\nThe second statement is: \"The pants might not have been denim\"\nThis means: It's possible that ¬Denim (the pants were not denim)\n\nThe question asks if we can infer: \"The shirt was not cotton\" (¬Cotton)\n\nLet me consider the logical relationship:\n- From \"Cotton → Denim\", the contrapositive is \"¬Denim → ¬Cotton\"\n- The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement\n\nHowever, the second premise only says the pants \"might not have been denim\" - this indicates possibility, not certainty. It doesn't establish that the pants definitely were not denim.\n\nFor us to use the contrapositive to conclude ¬Cotton, we would need to know that ¬Denim is actually true (the pants definitely were not denim).\n\nSince we only know it's possible that the pants were not denim, we cannot definitively conclude that the shirt was not cotton. The pants could still have been denim, in which case the conditional would be satisfied regardless of whether the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
