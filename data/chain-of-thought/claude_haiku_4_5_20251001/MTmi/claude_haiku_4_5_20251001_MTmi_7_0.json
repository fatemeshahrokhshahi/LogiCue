This is different from saying Chris *definitely* did not finish.\n\nIf we only know that ¬C is *possible* but not *certain*, we cannot definitively conclude ¬A. We would need to know that Chris *definitely* did not finish in order to use the contrapositive to conclude that Alex did not finish.\n\nThe fact that something is possible doesn't allow us to make a definite inference. We would be committing the fallacy of affirming the consequent or making an invalid inference from possibility to actuality.\n\nAnswer: no",
