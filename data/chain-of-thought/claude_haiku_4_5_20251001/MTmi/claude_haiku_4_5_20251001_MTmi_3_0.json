            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical reasoning step by step.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\"\nThis can be written as: If P, then Q (where P = \"written by James\" and Q = \"is a mystery novel\")\n\nThe second statement is: \"The book might not be a mystery novel.\"\nThis means: Q is possibly false (it's not necessarily true that Q is true)\n\nThe question asks: Can we infer \"The book was not written by James\" (i.e., not-P)?\n\nTo validly infer \"not-P\" from \"If P, then Q,\" we would need to know that Q is definitely false. This is called modus tollens: If (P→Q) and not-Q, then not-P.\n\nHowever, the second statement only says the book \"might not be\" a mystery novel—meaning it's possible that Q is false, not that Q is definitely false. The book could still be a mystery novel.\n\nSince we don't have certainty that Q is false, we cannot validly apply modus tollens. The book might be a mystery novel (in which case James could have written it), or it might not be (in which case James didn't write it).\n\nAnswer: no",
