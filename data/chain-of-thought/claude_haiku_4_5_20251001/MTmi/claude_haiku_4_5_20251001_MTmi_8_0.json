It doesn't tell us that the mummy *definitely* was not awake. \"Might not have been\" expresses possibility, not certainty.\n\nTo use the contrapositive to conclude ¬V, we would need to know that ¬M is actually true (the mummy definitely was not awake). But we only know it's possible.\n\nSince we cannot establish that the mummy definitely was not awake, we cannot definitively infer that the vampire was not awake. The vampire might have been awake (with the mummy also awake), or the vampire might not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
