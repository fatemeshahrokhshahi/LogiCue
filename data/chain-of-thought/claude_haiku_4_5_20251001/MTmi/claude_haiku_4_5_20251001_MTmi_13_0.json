            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical reasoning step by step.\n\nThe first statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\"\nThis is a conditional: If P (car is red), then Q (truck is blue).\nIn logical form: P → Q\n\nThe second statement is: \"The truck might not have been blue.\"\nThis means it's possible that the truck was not blue. This indicates uncertainty about Q - it could be true or false.\nIn logical form: ¬Q is possible (or ~Q is not necessarily false)\n\nNow, can we infer \"The car was not red\" (¬P)?\n\nThe logical principle here is modus tollens: If we have P → Q and we know ¬Q (Q is definitely false), then we can conclude ¬P.\n\nHowever, the second statement only says the truck \"might not have been blue\" - meaning it's *possible* that ¬Q, not that ¬Q is *definitely true*. The truck could still have been blue.\n\nSince we don't have certainty that Q is false, we cannot apply modus tollens with certainty. The car could still have been red (in which case the truck would have been blue), or the car might not have been red (in which case the truck could be any color).\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
