This is different from \"definitely was not.\"\n\nIf we knew for certain that Q is false (the muffins definitely were not blueberry), then by modus tollens we could conclude P is false (the cake was not chocolate).\n\nBut \"might not have been\" only indicates possibility, not certainty. The muffins could still have been blueberry; we just know it's not necessary that they were.\n\nSince we cannot establish that Q is definitely false, we cannot use modus tollens to definitively conclude that P is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
