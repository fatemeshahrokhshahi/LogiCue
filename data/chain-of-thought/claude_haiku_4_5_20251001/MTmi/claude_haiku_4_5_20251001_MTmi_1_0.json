            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical reasoning step by step.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" - This is a conditional: Mary → Sue\n2. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" - This means it's possible that Sue was not at the wedding\n\nThe question asks if we can infer: \"Mary was not at the wedding\"\n\nLet me analyze this:\n\nFrom statement 1, we have: If Mary attended, then Sue must have attended.\nThe contrapositive of this would be: If Sue did not attend, then Mary did not attend.\n\nHowever, statement 2 only tells us that Sue *might not* have attended - it's possible but not certain that Sue was absent.\n\nThe key issue: We cannot definitively conclude that Sue was not at the wedding. Statement 2 only establishes that Sue's absence is *possible*, not that it actually occurred.\n\nSince we don't know for certain that Sue was absent, we cannot use the contrapositive to conclude that Mary was absent. Mary could have attended (with Sue also attending), or Mary could have not attended. Both scenarios are consistent with the given information.\n\nTo validly infer \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" we would need to know that Sue definitely was not at the wedding, not merely that it's possible she wasn't.\n\nAnswer: no",
