            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical reasoning step by step.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" - This is a conditional: Griffin in forest → Unicorn in forest\n2. \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\" - This means it's possible the unicorn was not in the forest\n\nThe question asks if we can infer: \"The griffin was not in the forest\"\n\nLet me analyze this:\n- Statement 1 gives us: Griffin → Unicorn (if griffin, then unicorn)\n- The contrapositive of this would be: ¬Unicorn → ¬Griffin (if not unicorn, then not griffin)\n- Statement 2 says the unicorn \"might not have been\" in the forest - this means it's possible but not certain that the unicorn was absent\n\nThe key issue: Statement 2 only tells us it's *possible* that the unicorn was not in the forest. It doesn't tell us that the unicorn definitely was not in the forest.\n\nTo use the contrapositive and conclude the griffin was not in the forest, we would need to know for certain that the unicorn was not in the forest. But \"might not have been\" is weaker than that - it's just a possibility.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the griffin was not in the forest. The unicorn could still have been in the forest, in which case the griffin could have been there too.\n\nAnswer: no",
