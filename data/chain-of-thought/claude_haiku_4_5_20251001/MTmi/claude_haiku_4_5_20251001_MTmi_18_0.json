            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical inference step by step.\n\nThe first statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\nThis can be written as: P → M (where P = doll was plastic, M = truck was metal)\n\nThe second statement is: \"The truck might not have been metal.\"\nThis means it's possible that the truck was not metal, or we cannot be certain the truck was metal. This indicates ¬M is possible (or that M is not necessarily true).\n\nNow, can we infer \"The doll was not plastic\" (¬P)?\n\nUsing the logical rule of modus tollens: If we have P → M, and we know ¬M is true, then we can conclude ¬P.\n\nHowever, the second statement says the truck \"might not have been metal\" - this means it's *possible* that ¬M, not that ¬M is *definitely* true. The statement doesn't assert that the truck definitely was not metal; it only says it might not have been.\n\nSince we only know that ¬M is *possible* (not certain), we cannot definitively apply modus tollens. We cannot conclude with certainty that the doll was not plastic - only that it's possible the doll was not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make this inference with logical certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
