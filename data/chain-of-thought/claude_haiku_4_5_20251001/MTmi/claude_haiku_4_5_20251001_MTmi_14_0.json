            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical reasoning step by step.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\" - This is a conditional: Bear in cave → Wolf in den\n2. \"The wolf might not have been in the den\" - This means it's possible the wolf was not in the den\n\nThe question asks if we can infer: \"The bear was not in the cave\"\n\nLet me analyze this:\n\nFrom statement 1, we have: Bear in cave → Wolf in den\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement would be: Wolf NOT in den → Bear NOT in cave\n\nHowever, statement 2 only tells us that the wolf MIGHT NOT have been in the den (it's possible, not certain). This is different from saying the wolf definitely was NOT in the den.\n\nSince statement 2 only establishes possibility, not actuality, we cannot definitively conclude that the wolf was not in the den. Therefore, we cannot use the contrapositive to definitively conclude that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nTo make the inference work, we would need statement 2 to say \"The wolf was not in the den\" (a definite fact), not \"might not have been\" (a possibility).\n\nAnswer: no",
