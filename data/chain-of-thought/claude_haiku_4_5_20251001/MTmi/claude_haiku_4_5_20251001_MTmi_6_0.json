            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical reasoning step by step.\n\nFirst, let me identify the statements:\n1. \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" - This is a conditional: If P then Q (where P = Sue chose pizza, Q = Bob chose pasta)\n2. \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" - This means it's possible that Bob did not choose pasta, or we cannot be certain Bob chose pasta\n3. Question: Can we infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\"?\n\nThe logical form of statement 1 is: P → Q (If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta)\n\nNow, statement 2 says \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\" This means we cannot definitively say that Q is true - it's possible that ¬Q (Bob did not choose pasta).\n\nIf we know that Q is not necessarily true (Bob might not have chosen pasta), and we have P → Q, can we conclude ¬P?\n\nThis would be using the logical principle: If P → Q, and Q is false (or possibly false), then P must be false.\n\nHowever, there's a subtle issue here. \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" means it's *possible* that Bob didn't choose pasta, not that we *know for certain* Bob didn't choose pasta. \n\nBut if the conditional states \"Bob *must have* chosen pasta\" (a strong necessity claim), and we're told Bob *might not have* chosen pasta (contradicting that necessity), then the only way to resolve this contradiction is if the antecedent P is false. If Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob would have to have chosen pasta, but since Bob might not have, Sue could not have chosen pizza.\n\nYes, we can make this inference through modus tollens reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
