            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic logical inference problem involving modus tollens.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\"\n  - This can be written as: If P, then Q (where P = \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q = \"Amy must have played tennis\")\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\"\n  - This means: Not Q\n\nThe logical rule of modus tollens states: If we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"Not Q,\" then we can validly infer \"Not P.\"\n\nApplying this:\n- We have: If P, then Q\n- We have: Not Q\n- Therefore: Not P (which means \"Jeff did not play basketball\")\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference. The second statement directly contradicts the consequent of the conditional in the first statement, which allows us to reject the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
