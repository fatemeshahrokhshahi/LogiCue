            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical inference step by step.\n\nFirst, let me identify the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" \n  This is: P → Q (where P = \"Sam took a plane\" and Q = \"Erin must have taken a train\")\n\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train\"\n  This is: ¬Q (the negation of Q)\n\n- Proposed conclusion: \"Sam did not take a plane\"\n  This is: ¬P (the negation of P)\n\nNow, this is a classic application of the logical rule called **Modus Tollens**:\n- If we have P → Q (if P then Q)\n- And we have ¬Q (not Q)\n- Then we can validly infer ¬P (not P)\n\nThe reasoning is: If P were true, then Q would have to be true (by the conditional). But Q is false. Therefore, P cannot be true; P must be false.\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
