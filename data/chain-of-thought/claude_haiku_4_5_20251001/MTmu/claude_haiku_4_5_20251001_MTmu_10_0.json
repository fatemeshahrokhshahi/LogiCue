            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic logical inference problem involving modus tollens.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside\" \n  - This can be written as: If P, then Q (where P = \"dog was inside\" and Q = \"cat must have been outside\")\n  - Symbolically: P → Q\n\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside\"\n  - This means: Not Q\n  - Symbolically: ¬Q\n\n- Proposed conclusion: \"The dog was not inside\"\n  - This means: Not P\n  - Symbolically: ¬P\n\nThe logical rule of modus tollens states: If we have (P → Q) and ¬Q, we can validly infer ¬P.\n\nIn this case:\n- We have P → Q (Statement 1)\n- We have ¬Q (Statement 2)\n- Therefore, we can validly conclude ¬P\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference. If the conditional statement is true and we know the consequent is false, then the antecedent must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
