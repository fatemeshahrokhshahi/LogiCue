            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic application of modus tollens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\"\n  - In logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"Tom watched football\" and Q = \"Jen watched basketball\")\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\"\n  - In logical form: Not Q\n\nModus tollens states: If we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can validly conclude \"Not P.\"\n\nThe reasoning works as follows:\n- We're told that IF Tom watched football, THEN Jen must have watched basketball\n- We're told that Jen did NOT watch basketball\n- Therefore, the condition that would have made Jen watch basketball (Tom watching football) must not have occurred\n- So Tom did not watch football\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference. The second statement directly contradicts the consequent of the conditional in the first statement, which allows us to deny the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
