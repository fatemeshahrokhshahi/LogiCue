            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference using modus tollens.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" \n  This is: If P, then Q (where P = \"cake was chocolate\" and Q = \"muffins were blueberry\")\n\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\"\n  This is: Not Q\n\n- Proposed conclusion: \"The cake was not chocolate\"\n  This is: Not P\n\nModus tollens is a valid logical rule that states: If we have \"If P then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can validly infer \"Not P.\"\n\nIn this case:\n- We have: P → Q (If cake was chocolate, then muffins were blueberry)\n- We have: ¬Q (The muffins were not blueberry)\n- Therefore: ¬P (The cake was not chocolate)\n\nThis is a textbook application of modus tollens, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
