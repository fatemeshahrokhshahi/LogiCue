            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic logical inference problem involving modus tollens.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\"\n  - In logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"written by James\" and Q = \"must be a mystery novel\")\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\"\n  - In logical form: Not Q\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer: \"The book was not written by James\" (Not P)\n\nThis is the valid logical rule called modus tollens:\n- If P → Q (If P then Q)\n- ¬Q (Not Q)\n- Therefore: ¬P (Not P)\n\nThe reasoning works as follows: We're told that IF James wrote it, THEN it must be a mystery novel. We're also told that it's NOT a mystery novel. Therefore, the condition that would make it a mystery novel (James writing it) must not have occurred. If James had written it, it would have to be a mystery novel, but it isn't, so James didn't write it.\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
