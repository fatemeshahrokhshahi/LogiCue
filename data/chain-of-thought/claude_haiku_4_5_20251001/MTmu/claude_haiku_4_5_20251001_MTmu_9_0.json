            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic application of modus tollens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"\n  - This can be written as: If P, then Q (where P = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q = \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt\")\n  \n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"\n  - This means: Not Q\n\n- Proposed conclusion: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\"\n  - This means: Not P\n\nModus tollens is a valid inference rule that states: If we have \"If P then Q\" and we know \"Not Q,\" we can validly conclude \"Not P.\"\n\nThe reasoning works as follows:\n1. If P → Q (given)\n2. ¬Q (given)\n3. Therefore, ¬P (by modus tollens)\n\nSince we're told that Mark did NOT have to buy the blue shirt (¬Q), and we know that IF Lisa bought the red shirt THEN Mark would have to buy the blue shirt, we can conclude that Lisa did NOT buy the red shirt. If she had, then Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, which contradicts what we know.\n\nAnswer: yes",
