            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic application of modus tollens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" \n  - In logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q = \"Bob must have chosen pasta\")\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\"\n  - In logical form: Not Q\n\nModus tollens states: If we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can validly conclude \"Not P.\"\n\nThe reasoning works as follows:\n- We're told that IF Sue chose pizza, THEN Bob must have chosen pasta (a conditional relationship)\n- We're told that Bob did NOT have to choose pasta (the consequent is false)\n- Therefore, the only way both statements can be true is if Sue did NOT choose pizza (the antecedent must be false)\n\nIf Sue had chosen pizza, then by the first statement, Bob would have had to choose pasta. But we know Bob didn't have to choose pasta. So Sue couldn't have chosen pizza.\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
