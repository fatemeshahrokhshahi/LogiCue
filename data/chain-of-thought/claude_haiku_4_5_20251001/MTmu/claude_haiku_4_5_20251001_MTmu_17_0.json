            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic application of modus tollens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad\" \n  - This can be written as: P → Q (where P = \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q = \"Kate must have eaten the salad\")\n\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad\"\n  - This can be written as: ¬Q (the negation of Q)\n\nModus tollens states: If we have (P → Q) and ¬Q, we can validly infer ¬P.\n\nThe reasoning works as follows:\n- We're told that IF Ben ate pasta, THEN Kate must have eaten the salad\n- We're told that Kate did NOT eat the salad (¬Q is true)\n- Therefore, the condition that would have made Kate eat the salad (Ben eating pasta) must not have occurred\n- So Ben did not eat pasta (¬P)\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
