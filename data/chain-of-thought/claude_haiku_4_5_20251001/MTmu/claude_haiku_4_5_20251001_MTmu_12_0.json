            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic application of modus tollens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" \n  - This can be written as: If P, then Q (where P = \"Joe went to the park\" and Q = \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\")\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\"\n  - This means: Not Q\n\nModus tollens states: If we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"Not Q,\" then we can validly conclude \"Not P.\"\n\nThe reasoning works as follows:\n- We're told that IF Joe went to the park, THEN Lucy must have gone to the zoo\n- We're told that Lucy did NOT go to the zoo (or it's not the case that she must have)\n- Therefore, the condition that would have made Lucy go to the zoo (Joe going to the park) must not have occurred\n- So Joe did not go to the park\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
