            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical inference problem involving modus tollens.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\"\n  - In logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"bear in cave\" and Q = \"wolf in den\")\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den\"\n  - In logical form: Not Q\n\nThe question asks if we can infer: \"The bear was not in the cave\" (Not P)\n\nThis is the classic form of modus tollens:\n- If P, then Q\n- Not Q\n- Therefore, Not P\n\nModus tollens is a valid form of deductive reasoning. When we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and we know the consequent is false (Not Q), we can validly conclude that the antecedent must be false (Not P).\n\nIn this case:\n- We know: If bear in cave → wolf in den\n- We know: Wolf NOT in den\n- Therefore: Bear NOT in cave\n\nThis inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
