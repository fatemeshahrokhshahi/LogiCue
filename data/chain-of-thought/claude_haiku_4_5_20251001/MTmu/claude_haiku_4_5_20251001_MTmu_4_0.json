            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic application of modus tollens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\"\n  - In logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"alien visited Mars\" and Q = \"robot visited Jupiter\")\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter\"\n  - In logical form: Not Q\n\nModus tollens states: If we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can validly conclude \"Not P.\"\n\nApplying this:\n- We have: P → Q (If alien visited Mars, then robot visited Jupiter)\n- We have: ¬Q (The robot did not visit Jupiter)\n- Therefore: ¬P (The alien did not visit Mars)\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference. The reasoning is sound because if the consequent (Q) is false, and Q must follow from P, then P cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
