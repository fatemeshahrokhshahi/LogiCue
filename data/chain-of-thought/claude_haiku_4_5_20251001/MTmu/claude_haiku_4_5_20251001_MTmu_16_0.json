            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic application of modus tollens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" \n  - This can be written as: If P, then Q (or P → Q)\n  - Where P = \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q = \"the pants must have been denim\"\n\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\"\n  - This means: Not Q (or ¬Q)\n\n- Proposed conclusion: \"The shirt was not cotton\"\n  - This means: Not P (or ¬P)\n\nModus tollens states: If we have (P → Q) and ¬Q, we can validly infer ¬P.\n\nThe reasoning works as follows: If the shirt being cotton necessarily leads to the pants being denim, but the pants are NOT denim, then the shirt cannot have been cotton. If it were cotton, the pants would have to be denim, which contradicts what we know.\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
