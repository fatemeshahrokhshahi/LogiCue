            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this logical inference step by step.\n\nGiven statements:\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" - This is a conditional: Mary → Sue\n2. \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\" - This negates the consequent: ¬Sue\n\nThe question asks if we can infer: \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (¬Mary)\n\nThis is a classic application of modus tollens, which is a valid logical rule:\n- If we have: P → Q (If P then Q)\n- And we have: ¬Q (Not Q)\n- Then we can validly conclude: ¬P (Not P)\n\nApplying this to our statements:\n- We have: Mary → Sue\n- We have: ¬Sue (Sue must not have been at the wedding)\n- Therefore: ¬Mary (Mary was not at the wedding)\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference. When the consequent of a conditional is false, the antecedent must also be false for the conditional to remain true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
