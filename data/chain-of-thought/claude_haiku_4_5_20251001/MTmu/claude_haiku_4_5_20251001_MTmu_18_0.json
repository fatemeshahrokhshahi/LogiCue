            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic application of modus tollens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" \n  - This can be written as: P → M (If P, then M)\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\"\n  - This means: ¬M (Not M)\n\nModus tollens states: If we have (P → M) and ¬M, we can validly conclude ¬P.\n\nThe reasoning works as follows:\n- We're told that IF the doll was plastic, THEN the truck was metal\n- We're told the truck was NOT metal\n- Therefore, the doll could not have been plastic (because if it were, the truck would have to be metal, but it isn't)\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
