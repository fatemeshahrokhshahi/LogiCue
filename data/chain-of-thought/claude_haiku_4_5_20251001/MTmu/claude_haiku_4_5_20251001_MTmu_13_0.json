            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic application of modus tollens, a valid form of deductive reasoning.\n\nLet me set up the logical structure:\n- Statement 1: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" = If P, then Q\n- Statement 2: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\" = Not Q\n- Proposed conclusion: \"The car was not red\" = Not P\n\nModus tollens has the form:\n- If P, then Q\n- Not Q\n- Therefore, not P\n\nThis is a valid logical inference. When we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and we know the consequent is false (Not Q), we can validly conclude that the antecedent must be false (Not P).\n\nIn this case:\n- We're told: If the car was red → the truck was blue\n- We're told: The truck was NOT blue\n- Therefore: The car was NOT red\n\nThis reasoning is logically sound.\n\nAnswer: yes",
