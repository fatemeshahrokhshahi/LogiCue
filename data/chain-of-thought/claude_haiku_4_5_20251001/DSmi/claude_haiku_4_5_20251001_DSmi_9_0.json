It leaves open the possibility that B could be true or false.\n\nFor us to validly infer A from (A ∨ B), we would need to know that B is definitely false. However, statement 2 only tells us that B is possibly false, not that it is necessarily false.\n\nSince we cannot definitively rule out B, we cannot use disjunctive syllogism to conclude A with certainty. The puzzle piece might still be blending in on the floor (statement 2 allows for this possibility), so we cannot definitively conclude it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: no",
