It doesn't tell us that B is definitely false. B could still be true; it's just not certain.\n\nFor a valid disjunctive syllogism, we would need: \"A OR B\" combined with \"NOT B\" (definite negation) to conclude \"A.\"\n\nSince statement 2 only says B \"might not\" be true (expressing uncertainty rather than definite falsity), we cannot definitively conclude that A must be true. B could still be under the couch despite the possibility that it might not be.\n\nAnswer: no",
