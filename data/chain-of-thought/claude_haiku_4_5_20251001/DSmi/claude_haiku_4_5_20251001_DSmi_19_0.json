Either the watch is charging on the dresser OR it must be on his wrist (inclusive or exclusive disjunction)\n2. The watch might not be on his wrist\n\nThe question asks if we can definitively infer: \"The watch is charging on the dresser\"\n\nLet me analyze this:\n\nFrom premise 1, we have: A OR B (where A = watch is charging on dresser, B = watch is on his wrist)\n\nFrom premise 2, we know: It's possible that NOT B (the watch might not be on his wrist)\n\nThe key issue is that premise 2 only tells us it's *possible* that the watch is not on his wrist—it doesn't tell us that the watch is *definitely* not on his wrist. \"Might not be\" expresses possibility, not certainty.\n\nFor a valid disjunctive syllogism, we would need: \"The watch is definitely NOT on his wrist\" to conclude \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\nSince premise 2 only establishes possibility (not certainty), we cannot definitively rule out that the watch is on his wrist. Therefore, we cannot validly infer that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
