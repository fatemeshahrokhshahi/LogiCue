It means \"it is possible that Fido is not in the garden,\" but this doesn't tell us that Fido definitely is not in the garden.\n\nFor a valid disjunctive syllogism, we would need to know that one disjunct is definitely false. Here, we only know that one disjunct might be false, which is not sufficient.\n\nFor example:\n- Fido could be inside (satisfying the disjunction)\n- Fido could be in the garden (also satisfying the disjunction)\n- Both are consistent with \"might not be in the garden\"\n\nSince we cannot definitively rule out that Fido is in the garden, we cannot validly infer that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
