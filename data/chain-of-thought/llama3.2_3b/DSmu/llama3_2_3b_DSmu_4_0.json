The first statement says either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom. This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. However, the second statement says \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\", which means we can rule out the option of the cat playing in the bedroom. \n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that the only remaining option is for the cat to be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
