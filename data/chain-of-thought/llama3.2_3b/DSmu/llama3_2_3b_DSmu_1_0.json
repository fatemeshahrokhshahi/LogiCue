This implies that if Fido is not inside, then he must be in the garden. However, the second statement says \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\", which means it's actually true that Fido is not in the garden. \n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that since Fido cannot be in the garden (as per the second statement), and if he's not in the garden then he must be inside (from the first statement), we can infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
