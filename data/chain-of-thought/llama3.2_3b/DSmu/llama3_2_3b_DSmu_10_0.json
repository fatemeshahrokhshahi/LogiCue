This statement presents two possible locations for the missing sock and indicates that one of these options must be true.\n\nNext, we have \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\". This statement directly negates the possibility of the missing sock being under the bed, which means it supports the first option: the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nSince the second statement eliminates one possible location for the missing sock (under the bed), we can conclude that the only remaining option is that the missing sock is indeed in the laundry basket. \n\nAnswer: yes",
