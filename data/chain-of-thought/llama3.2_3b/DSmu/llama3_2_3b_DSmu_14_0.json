The first statement says either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge. This implies that there are two possible locations for the milk: on the counter or in the fridge. However, the second statement explicitly states \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\", which means we can rule out the possibility of the milk being in the fridge. \n\nGiven this information, we're left with only one option: the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
