The first statement, \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk,\" presents two mutually exclusive options for the pen's location. This means that one of these options must be true.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk,\" directly negates the possibility of the pen being on the desk. Since we know that it can't be on the desk (because it's not the case), this leaves us with only one option: the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
