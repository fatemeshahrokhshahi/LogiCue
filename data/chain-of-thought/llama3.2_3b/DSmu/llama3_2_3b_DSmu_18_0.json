The first statement, \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand,\" presents two possibilities for the location of the notebook. However, this statement does not provide any information about the actual location of the notebook.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" tells us that the notebook cannot be definitively said to be sitting on the nightstand. This means we can rule out one possibility from the first statement, but it does not provide any information about where the notebook actually is.\n\nGiven this analysis, we cannot infer \"The notebook is in the drawer\" because the statements do not provide enough information to determine its location with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
