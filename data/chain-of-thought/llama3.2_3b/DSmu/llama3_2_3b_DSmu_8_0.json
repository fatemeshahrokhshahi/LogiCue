If it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch, then we can conclude that the remote control is either on the coffee table or in some other location (not specified). However, since the only other option mentioned is being hidden under the couch, which has been ruled out, we're left with the conclusion that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
