If it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest (i.e., ~B), then we cannot conclude that the griffin was in the forest because the conditional statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B is also true.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest. If the griffin were in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest (by the first statement). But since it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest (the second statement), we can conclude that the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
