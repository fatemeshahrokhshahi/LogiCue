The first statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This implies that for the book to be a mystery novel, it must have been written by James.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This means we cannot conclude that the book is indeed a mystery novel based on the first statement alone.\n\n3. Now, let's examine if we can infer \"The book was not written by James\" from these statements. If it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel (statement 2), then there are other possibilities for what kind of book it is. This does not necessarily mean the book wasn't written by James, but rather that being written by James doesn't guarantee it's a mystery novel.\n\n4. However, if we combine these statements with the fact that \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel,\" we can infer that there are other possibilities for what kind of book it is, and one of those possibilities is that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
