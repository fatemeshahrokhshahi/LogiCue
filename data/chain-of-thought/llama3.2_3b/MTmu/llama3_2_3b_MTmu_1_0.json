            "content": "Explanation: To evaluate this inference, let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", which means if Mary was at the wedding (A), then Sue must have been at the wedding (B). The second statement is its negation, meaning it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can't directly infer anything about Mary being present or absent. However, from the second statement, we know that if Sue must have been at the wedding, then she actually was there. Since this is not the case (it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding), it implies that Sue did not attend the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider Mary. The first statement only connects Mary to Sue; it doesn't provide any information about Mary herself. Therefore, we can't infer anything about Mary being present or absent based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
