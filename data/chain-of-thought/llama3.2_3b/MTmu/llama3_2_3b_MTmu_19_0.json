            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer \"Tom did not watch football\" from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step. The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", where A is \"Tom watched football\" and B is \"Jen must have watched basketball\". This means that if Tom indeed watched football, we can conclude that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nThe second statement is a negation of the conclusion drawn from the first statement. It states that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. Since this statement directly contradicts the conclusion of the first statement, we can infer that the antecedent (the condition) of the first statement - \"Tom watched football\" - cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, given that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
