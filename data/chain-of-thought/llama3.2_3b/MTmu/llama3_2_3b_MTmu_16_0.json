            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step. \n\nFrom the first statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\", we know that there is a conditional relationship between the type of shirt and the type of pants. However, this does not provide direct information about the type of shirt.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\", tells us that the condition in the first statement is not met. This means that the pants are not necessarily denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between these statements and the inference we want to make. If we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton from the given statements, it would mean that the conditional relationship in the first statement is not satisfied. However, this does not provide direct evidence for the type of shirt.\n\nWe know that if the pants are not denim (as stated), then the condition \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" cannot be met. But we also know that there is no information about the type of shirt in the second statement. \n\nTherefore, based on these statements alone, we cannot infer with certainty whether the shirt was or was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
