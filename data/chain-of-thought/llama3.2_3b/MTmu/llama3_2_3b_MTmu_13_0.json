            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer \"The car was not red\" from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step. The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the car was red\" and B is \"the truck must have been blue\". This means that if the car was indeed red, then we can conclude that the truck must be blue.\n\nThe second statement is a negation of the conclusion drawn from the first statement. It says \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\", which implies that it's possible for the truck to be any color other than blue (including being red).\n\nNow, let's examine if we can infer \"The car was not red\" from these statements. If we assume that the first statement is true and the car was indeed red, then we would conclude that the truck must be blue. However, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue, which means our initial assumption about the car being red cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, if we combine these two statements, we can infer that \"The car was not red\" because if the first statement were true, the second statement would contradict it. So, by using modus tollens (a rule of inference), we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
