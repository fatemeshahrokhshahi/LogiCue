This means that the condition of the vampire being awake does not lead to the conclusion that the mummy is awake.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that if the vampire was awake, then the statement \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\" would still hold true because it's based on a hypothetical scenario where the vampire is awake. \n\nTherefore, since we cannot derive any direct conclusion about the vampire being awake from the second statement alone, and given that the first statement only implies the mummy's wakefulness if the vampire is awake, we can't directly infer \"The vampire was not awake\" from these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
