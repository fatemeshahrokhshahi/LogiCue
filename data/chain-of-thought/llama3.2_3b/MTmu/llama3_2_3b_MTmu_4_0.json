In other words, there is no guarantee that the robot visited Jupiter if the alien visited Mars.\n\nNow, let's consider what these statements tell us about the alien visiting Mars. If we know that \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter,\" then it means that either the alien did not visit Mars or the robot did not visit Jupiter (or both). \n\nHowever, from the first statement, if the alien visited Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter. But since we are told that it is not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter, this implies that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
