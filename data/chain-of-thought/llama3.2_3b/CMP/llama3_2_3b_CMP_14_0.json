    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

We know that a minimum wage hike is most probable and paid family leave is less likely. If a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, then it's more likely that loan forgiveness will happen because there are no other new laws being passed. Additionally, since a minimum wage hike is expected to happen, it's also true that paid family leave won't happen.\n\nAnswer: yes",
