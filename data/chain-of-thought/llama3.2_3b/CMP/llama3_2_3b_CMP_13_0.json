    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a syllogism, where we have two premises and a conclusion. The first premise states that if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then Missouri will. The second premise states that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then Georgia won't. We need to determine whether these premises logically lead us to conclude that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then Missouri will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
