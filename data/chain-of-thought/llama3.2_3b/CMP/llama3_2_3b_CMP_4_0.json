    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?",

            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether it follows that it is likely that, if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will, we need to analyze the given information carefully. The hiring manager's initial assessment of the candidates' likelihood of getting the role is based on their resumes. However, this assessment is conditional upon Julian not getting the offer, which implies that Priya has already been offered the role. \n\nGiven this condition, if Priya doesn't get the offer, it would mean that Julian got the offer instead (since Julian was considered a longshot and only after Priya). Since Diego will only be offered the role if both Priya and Julian don't get it, and Julian has already been offered the role in this scenario, it logically follows that Diego won't get the offer. Therefore, if Priya doesn't get the offer, it is indeed likely that Diego will.\n\nAnswer: no",
