    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it’s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a syllogism, a form of logical argument. The premises are:\n\n1. If solar power doesn't generate the most electricity, then wind power will.\n2. Tidal power likely generates the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't.\n\nThe conclusion to be drawn is that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will. However, this conclusion is not logically sound because premise 1 assumes that solar power must generate the most electricity in order for wind power to take its place, but it does not account for the possibility of other sources (such as a combination of solar and wind) generating more electricity than tidal power.\n\nAnswer: no",
