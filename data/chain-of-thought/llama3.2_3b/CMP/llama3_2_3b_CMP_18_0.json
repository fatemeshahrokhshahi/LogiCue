    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

However, these conditions are not logically equivalent to each other. Just because burgers aren't the top takeout item ordered doesn't necessarily mean that tacos will be if pizza isn't; it could also mean that another food is the top item. Similarly, just because pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered doesn't necessarily mean that tacos will be.\n\nAnswer: no",
