This statement presents two mutually exclusive options for the location of the pen.\n\nSecond statement: \"The pen might not be on my desk\". This statement directly contradicts one of the options presented in the first statement, which was that the pen must be on my desk. \n\nGiven these statements, we can conclude that since the second statement says the pen is not on the desk, it supports the first statement's alternative option: \"the pen is in my bag\". Therefore, based on the information provided, we can indeed infer that \"The pen is in my bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
