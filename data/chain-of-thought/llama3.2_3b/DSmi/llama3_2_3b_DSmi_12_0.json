This gives us a binary choice.\n\nHowever, the second statement adds that \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\". This introduces an additional possibility - the jacket is neither draped over the chair nor hanging in the closet (it's somewhere else).\n\nGiven this new information, we can't conclude with certainty that the jacket is draped over the chair. The original two options are still on the table, and we have a third option to consider.\n\nAnswer: no",
