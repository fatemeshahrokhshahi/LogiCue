The first statement says either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. This implies that there are two possibilities for the book's location.\n2. The second statement says \"The book might not be resting on the table\". This statement directly contradicts the idea of the book being on the table, but does not provide any information about its position on the shelf.\n\nFrom these statements alone, we cannot conclude with certainty that the book is on the shelf because the first statement leaves room for the possibility of the book being on the table. The second statement only eliminates the option of the book being on the table, but does not rule out the possibility of it being on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no",
