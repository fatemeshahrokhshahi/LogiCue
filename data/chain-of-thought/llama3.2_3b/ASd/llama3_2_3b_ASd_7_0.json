The original statement implies that if the oven is on, it will cause the kitchen to be warm due to the heat emitted by the oven. However, the new statement adds a condition about the pilot light being out, which introduces an additional variable (the state of the pilot light) that may not necessarily affect the warmth of the kitchen.\n\nAnswer: no",
