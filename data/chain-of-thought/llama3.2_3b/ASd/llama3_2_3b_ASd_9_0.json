The original statement \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A\" sets up a conditional relationship between being well-written and getting an A. If we add another condition (being turned in late) that is also related to the outcome (getting an A), we can infer that if both conditions are met (the essay is well-written and turned in late), then the student will still get an A.\n\nAnswer: no",
