The original statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" sets up a condition (getting enough sleep) and its consequence (not being tired). To infer the second statement, we need to apply the same logic to the new situation. However, there is no inherent reason why getting enough sleep would automatically eliminate fatigue caused by hard labor. The original statement only addresses the relationship between sleep and tiredness in a general sense, without considering other factors that might affect physical exertion.\n\nAnswer: No",
