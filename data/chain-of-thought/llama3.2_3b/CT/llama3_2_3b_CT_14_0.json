Modus tollens states that if A implies B (A → B), and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A is also false. In this case, \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" (A) implies \"the wolf was in the den\" (B). Since we are given that \"the wolf was not in the den\", we can apply modus tollens to conclude that \"the bear was not in the cave\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
