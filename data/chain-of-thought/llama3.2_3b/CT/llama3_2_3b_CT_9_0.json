            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the given statement from the original one, let's analyze the logical structure. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". This type of statement is known as a material implication.\n\nThe inference we're considering is also a conditional statement of the form \"If C, then D\", where C is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" and D is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\nWe can rewrite the original statement as \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" which implies that if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, then Mark definitely wouldn't have bought the blue shirt. However, this does not directly imply that if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nIn other words, we can only conclude that if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, it's possible (but not necessarily true) that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. We cannot rule out the possibility that Mark bought the blue shirt even though Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the given statement from the original one with absolute certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
