            "content": "Explanation: To make an inference from the given statement, we need to consider the logical structure of the conditional statement. The original statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This implies a relationship between the two statements, where if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nTo infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\", we need to consider the following:\n\n* If the pants are not denim, it means they do not meet the condition of being denim.\n* Since the original statement implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must also be denim, it follows that if the pants are not denim, the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" is a logically consistent and valid conclusion based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
