            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of inference that allows us to draw conclusions from conditional statements. The original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be rewritten as \"The vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake\". From this, we can infer that if the mummy is not awake, it cannot be the case that the vampire is awake (because the implication does not hold). Therefore, we can conclude that \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
