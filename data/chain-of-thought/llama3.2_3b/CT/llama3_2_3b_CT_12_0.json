            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the statement \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\", we need to analyze the given conditional statement. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\". In this case, A is \"Joe went to the park\" and B is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nThe converse of the original statement would be \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park\", which is not necessarily true. However, we are interested in the inverse of the original statement, which would be \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\". This is a different conditional statement.\n\nIn general, if we have a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", we cannot infer the inverse statement \"If not A, then not B\" without additional information. The original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between Joe's and Lucy's actions when one or both of them do not go to their respective destinations.\n\nTherefore, based on the given conditional statement alone, we cannot infer that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
