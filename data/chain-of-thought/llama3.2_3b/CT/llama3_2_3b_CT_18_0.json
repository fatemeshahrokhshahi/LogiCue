            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the statement \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\", we need to analyze the given conditional statement. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\". In this case, A is \"the doll was plastic\" and B is \"the truck was metal\".\n\nTo infer the new statement, we would need to know if there's any relationship between the truth values of A and B. However, in this case, the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the two statements.\n\nIn general, conditional statements do not imply contrapositive statements (i.e., \"If not B, then not A\"). The only way to infer a contrapositive statement is if we have additional information that links the truth values of A and B. Therefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer the new statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
