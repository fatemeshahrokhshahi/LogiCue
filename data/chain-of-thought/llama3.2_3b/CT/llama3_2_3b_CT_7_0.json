The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\". In this case, A is \"Alex finished the race\" and B is \"Chris finished the race\".\n\nThe inference we are trying to make is also a conditional statement of the same form, but with different antecedents (A) and consequents (B). However, the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between Alex's finishing the race and Chris's finishing the race. It only tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\" from the original statement, because there is no logical connection between the two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
