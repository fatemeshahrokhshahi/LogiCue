In this case, \"If the book was written by James\" (A) implies \"the book is a mystery novel\" (B), and we know that the book is not a mystery novel. Therefore, using modus tollens, we can infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it must be true that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
