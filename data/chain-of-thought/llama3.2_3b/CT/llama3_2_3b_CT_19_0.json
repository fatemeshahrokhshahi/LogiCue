            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the statement \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\", we need to analyze the given conditional statement. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\". In this case, A is \"Tom watched football\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nThe converse of the original statement would be \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\", which is not necessarily true based on the given information. However, to determine if we can infer the inverse statement \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\".\n\nSince the original statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\", we can conclude that the contrapositive \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
