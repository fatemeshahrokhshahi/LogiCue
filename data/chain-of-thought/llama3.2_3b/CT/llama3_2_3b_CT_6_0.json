The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\". In this case, A is \"Sue chose pizza\" and B is \"Bob chose pasta\".\n\nTo infer the new statement, we would need to know if there's any relationship between Bob choosing pasta and Sue choosing pizza. However, the given statement only tells us that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob must choose pasta. It does not provide information about what happens when Bob doesn't choose pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement alone, we cannot infer anything about the relationship between Bob not choosing pasta and Sue not choosing pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
