            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the statement \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\", we need to analyze the given conditional statement. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\". In this case, A is \"Jeff played basketball\" and B is \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nThe inference we are asked about is also a conditional statement of the form \"If not A, then not B\", which is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\". Since we know that the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can conclude that the inference is valid. Therefore, we can indeed infer the statement \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
