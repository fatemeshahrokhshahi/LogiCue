            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the statement \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\", let's analyze the given statement. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\". In this case, A is \"the car was red\" and B is \"the truck was blue\".\n\nThe inference we're trying to make is also a conditional statement of the form \"If C, then D\", where C is \"the truck was not blue\" and D is \"the car was not red\". To determine if this inference is valid, we need to check if the original statement implies the negation of B (i.e., \"the truck was not blue\") would imply the negation of A (i.e., \"the car was not red\").\n\nIn logic, this type of inference is known as a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In our case, the original statement implies that if the truck was blue (B), then the car was red (A). Therefore, it also implies that if the truck was not blue (not B), then the car was not red (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
