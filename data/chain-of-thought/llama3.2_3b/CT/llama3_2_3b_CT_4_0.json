The original statement is a conditional statement that connects two events (the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter). However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between these events when they do not occur.\n\nIn order to infer 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars', we would need additional information or premises that establish a connection between the non-occurrence of one event and the other. The original statement does not provide such information, so we cannot logically deduce this conclusion from it.\n\nAnswer: no",
