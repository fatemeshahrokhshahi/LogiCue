            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the given statement from the original one, let's analyze the logical structure. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the cake was chocolate\" and B is \"the muffins were blueberry\". This type of statement is known as a material implication.\n\nTo infer \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\".\n\nSince the original statement and its contrapositive have the same truth value (i.e., they are logically equivalent), we can conclude that if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
