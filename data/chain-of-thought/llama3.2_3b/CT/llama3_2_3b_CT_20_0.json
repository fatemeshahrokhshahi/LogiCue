            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the statement \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\", we need to analyze the given conditional statement. The original statement is a conditional of the form \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\". This type of conditional is known as a material implication.\n\nIn material implication, if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true. However, if the antecedent is false, we cannot conclude that the consequent is necessarily true. In this case, if the apple was not red, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow.\n\nThe statement \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" is a contrapositive of the original conditional statement. The contrapositive of a material implication \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". Since the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the color of the banana and the color of the apple when the banana is yellow, we cannot infer that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
