            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, let's analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", which means that if Mary was at the wedding (A), then Sue must have been at the wedding (B). However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue was actually at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement is a simple assertion that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This introduces uncertainty about Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer Mary's presence or absence from the wedding. The first statement only tells us what would happen if Mary were present (Sue must be present), but it does not provide information about Mary's actual presence. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was not at the wedding based on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
