The first statement is a conditional statement that says if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must be there. However, it does not provide any information about whether the griffin actually is in the forest or not.\n\nThe second statement provides some uncertainty about the unicorn's presence in the forest, but it does not directly relate to the griffin's presence.\n\nGiven these statements together, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest. The first statement only tells us what would happen if the griffin is in the forest (the unicorn must be there), but it does not provide any information about whether the griffin actually is in the forest or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
