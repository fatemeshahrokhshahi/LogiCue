However, this does not necessarily mean that the robot actually visited Jupiter; it only means that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter.\n\nSecond, we are also given that \"The robot might not have visited Jupiter\" (Statement 2). This statement directly contradicts Statement 1, which implies that if the alien visits Mars, then the robot must visit Jupiter. \n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that it is impossible for both to be true at the same time. If the alien did visit Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter (Statement 1), but since the robot might not have visited Jupiter (Statement 2), this means that the alien cannot have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
