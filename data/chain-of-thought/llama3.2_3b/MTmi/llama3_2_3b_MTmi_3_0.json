The first statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This implies that for the book to be a mystery novel, it must have been written by James.\n2. However, the second statement is \"The book might not be a mystery novel.\" This introduces uncertainty about the genre of the book.\n\nFrom these statements alone, we cannot directly conclude that \"The book was not written by James\" because the first statement only establishes a condition for the book to be a mystery novel (written by James), but does not provide information about whether the book actually is a mystery novel. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the genre of the book.\n\nTherefore, based on these statements alone, we cannot infer \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
