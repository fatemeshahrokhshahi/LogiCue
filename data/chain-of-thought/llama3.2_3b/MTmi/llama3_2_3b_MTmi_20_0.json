The first statement is a conditional claim that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. However, the second statement introduces uncertainty about the banana's color by saying it might not have been yellow. \n\nGiven these two statements, we can't directly infer that the apple was not red because the first statement only provides a condition for the banana to be yellow, but does not provide any information about the apple's color. The uncertainty about the banana's color doesn't necessarily imply anything about the apple's color.\n\nAnswer: no",
