The first statement implies that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. However, this does not provide any direct information about the dog's location. The second statement tells us that the cat might not have been outside, which means it could also be inside. Since we don't know where the cat is, we cannot conclude anything about the dog's location based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
