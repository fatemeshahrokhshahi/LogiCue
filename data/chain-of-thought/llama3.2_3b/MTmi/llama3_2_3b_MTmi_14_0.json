The first statement implies a connection between the presence of the bear and the wolf, suggesting that if one is present, the other must also be present. However, the second statement introduces uncertainty about the wolf's presence in the den. Given these two statements together, we can't directly infer that the bear was not in the cave because the first statement only establishes a relationship between the bear and the wolf, but does not provide information about the bear's location.\n\nAnswer: no",
