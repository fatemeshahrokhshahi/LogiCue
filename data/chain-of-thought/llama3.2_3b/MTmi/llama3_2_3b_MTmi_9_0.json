The first statement implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. However, this does not necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt; it only establishes a connection between her action and Mark's potential action. The second statement introduces uncertainty about Mark's purchase of the blue shirt, which is separate from Lisa's potential purchase of the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
