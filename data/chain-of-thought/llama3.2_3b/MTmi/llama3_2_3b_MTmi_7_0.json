The first statement implies a conditional relationship between Alex and Chris's finishing times (if one finishes, the other must have finished). However, this does not provide direct information about Alex's performance or whether he actually finished the race. The second statement introduces uncertainty about Chris's performance but does not directly relate to Alex's actions.\n\nAnswer: no",
