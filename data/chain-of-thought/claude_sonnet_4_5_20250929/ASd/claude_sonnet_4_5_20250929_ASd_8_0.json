            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step by step using logical reasoning.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today\"\nThis can be written as: If P, then Q (where P = \"package has shipped\" and Q = \"it will arrive today\")\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today\"\nThis can be written as: If (P and R), then Q (where R = \"it was misrouted\")\n\nThe question is whether we can validly infer the second statement from the first.\n\nIn classical logic, this inference is valid. This follows from the principle of monotonicity (or strengthening the antecedent). If P is sufficient for Q, then P combined with any additional condition (P and R) should also be sufficient for Q. The logic is: if P alone guarantees Q, then P plus something else should still guarantee Q.\n\nFormally: From (P → Q), we can derive ((P ∧ R) → Q)\n\nThis is a valid rule of inference in classical propositional logic.\n\nHowever, I should note that in real-world reasoning, this might seem counterintuitive because if a package is misrouted, it typically would NOT arrive today. But the question is about logical inference from the given statement, not about real-world plausibility. Logically, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
