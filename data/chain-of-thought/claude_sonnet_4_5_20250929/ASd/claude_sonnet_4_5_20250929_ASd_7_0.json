            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer a conditional statement with an additional condition in the antecedent from a simpler conditional statement.\n\nWe start with: \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm\" (If P, then Q)\n\nWe want to know if we can infer: \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm\" (If P and R, then Q)\n\nThis is an instance of a valid logical principle called \"strengthening the antecedent\" or \"monotonicity of the conditional.\" In classical logic, if we know that P is sufficient for Q, then P combined with any additional condition R is also sufficient for Q.\n\nHere's why: If P alone guarantees Q, then having P plus something else (P and R) still guarantees Q. The additional condition R doesn't prevent Q from following, because P was already enough to ensure Q.\n\nFormally:\n- Given: P → Q\n- We want to show: (P ∧ R) → Q\n\nIf (P ∧ R) is true, then P is true (by conjunction elimination). Since P is true and we know P → Q, then Q must be true (by modus ponens). Therefore (P ∧ R) → Q is valid.\n\nIn this specific case: if the oven being on is sufficient to make the kitchen warm, then the oven being on (regardless of whether the pilot light is out or not) is still sufficient to make the kitchen warm.\n\nAnswer: yes",
