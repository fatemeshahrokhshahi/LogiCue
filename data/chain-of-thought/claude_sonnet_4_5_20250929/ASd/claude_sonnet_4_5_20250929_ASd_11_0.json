            "content": "Explanation: Let me analyze this logical inference step by step.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\"\nThis can be written as: If P, then Q (where P = \"get enough sleep\" and Q = \"won't be tired\")\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\"\nThis can be written as: If (P and R), then Q (where R = \"do hard labor\")\n\nThis is asking whether we can apply the logical principle called \"monotonicity\" or \"strengthening the antecedent.\" In classical logic, this principle states that if \"P implies Q\" is true, then \"P and R implies Q\" should also be true - adding extra conditions to the antecedent shouldn't invalidate the conclusion.\n\nHowever, this principle fails in real-world contexts where there are implicit assumptions. The original statement \"if you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" carries an implicit \"all else being equal\" or \"under normal circumstances\" clause. \n\nIn reality, doing hard labor is a factor that can cause tiredness independently of sleep. Even if someone gets enough sleep, hard labor can still make them tired. The original statement doesn't account for additional tiredness-causing factors that might be introduced.\n\nTherefore, we cannot validly make this inference because the added condition (hard labor) introduces a new factor that can independently cause the opposite of the conclusion (being tired).\n\nAnswer: no",
