            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can strengthen the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of a conditional statement while preserving the truth of the conclusion.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If I study hard, then I will pass the test\" (If P, then Q)\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If I study hard AND the test is in Chinese, then I will pass the test\" (If P and R, then Q)\n\nThis is asking about the logical principle called \"strengthening the antecedent.\" In classical logic, this inference is valid. Here's why:\n\nIf we know that P is sufficient for Q (studying hard is sufficient to pass), then P combined with any additional condition (P and R) should also be sufficient for Q. This is because:\n- If P alone guarantees Q\n- And we have both P and R\n- Then we certainly have P\n- Therefore we still get Q\n\nThe additional condition \"the test is in Chinese\" doesn't prevent the original sufficient condition from working. If studying hard guarantees passing regardless of circumstances, then studying hard while the test happens to be in Chinese should still guarantee passing.\n\nThis is a valid form of inference known as \"monotonicity\" of the conditional - adding extra conditions to the antecedent doesn't invalidate the consequent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
