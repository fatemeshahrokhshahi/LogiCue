However, the second statement only tells us that Q *might* not be true (it's possible that ¬Q), not that Q is definitely false.\n\nTo validly infer P from P ∨ Q, we would need to know definitively that ¬Q (Q is false). This would allow us to use disjunctive syllogism: from P ∨ Q and ¬Q, we can conclude P.\n\nHowever, \"might not be hiding under the couch\" (◇¬Q) is weaker than \"is not hiding under the couch\" (¬Q). The possibility that Q is false doesn't give us the certainty that Q is false, which we would need to make the inference.\n\nTherefore, we cannot validly infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: no",
