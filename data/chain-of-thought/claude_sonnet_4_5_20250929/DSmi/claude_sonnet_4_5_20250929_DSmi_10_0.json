Then, from \"L OR B\" and \"NOT B\", we could conclude L through disjunctive syllogism.\n\nHowever, \"might not be under the bed\" only tells us that it's possible the sock isn't there - not that it definitely isn't there. The sock could still be under the bed. Since we cannot rule out B with certainty, we cannot definitively conclude L.\n\nThe possibility that the sock is not under the bed doesn't give us enough information to make a definitive inference about where it actually is.\n\nAnswer: no",
