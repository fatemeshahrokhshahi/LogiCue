This is because □Q (Q is necessarily true) would mean Q is true in all possible worlds, which contradicts ◇¬Q (there exists a possible world where Q is false).\n\nSo from \"Fido might not be in the garden\" (◇¬Q), we can derive \"Fido is not necessarily in the garden\" (¬□Q).\n\nNow, given:\n1. P ∨ □Q (Either Fido is inside OR Fido must be in the garden)\n2. ¬□Q (Fido is not necessarily in the garden - derived from premise 2)\n\nUsing disjunctive syllogism: If we have (A ∨ B) and ¬B, we can conclude A.\n\nTherefore, from P ∨ □Q and ¬□Q, we can conclude P (Fido is inside).\n\nAnswer: yes",
