However, the second statement only tells us that Q *might* not be true (it's possible that Q is false), not that Q is *definitely* false.\n\nIf we knew with certainty that ¬Q (the sunglasses are definitely not on her head), then by disjunctive syllogism we could conclude P. But \"might not be\" only expresses possibility, not certainty.\n\nSince Q might be false but also might be true, we cannot definitively conclude that P must be true. The sunglasses could still be on her head (making Q true), which would satisfy the disjunction P ∨ Q without requiring P to be true.\n\nAnswer: no",
