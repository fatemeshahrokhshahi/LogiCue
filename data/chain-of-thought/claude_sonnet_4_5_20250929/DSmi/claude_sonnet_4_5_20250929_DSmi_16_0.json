This indicates: ◇¬Q (possibly not-Q)\n\nNow, the question is whether from P ∨ Q and ◇¬Q, we can infer P.\n\nThe key issue here is the modal qualifier \"might\" in the second statement. \"Might not be on my desk\" means it's possible the pen is not on my desk, but this doesn't mean the pen is definitely not on my desk. \n\nFor us to validly infer \"The pen is in my bag\" from \"P ∨ Q\", we would need to know definitively that ¬Q (the pen is NOT on my desk). However, \"might not be on my desk\" only tells us that ¬Q is possible, not that ¬Q is actually true.\n\nSince we only know that it's possible the pen is not on the desk (not that it definitely isn't on the desk), we cannot use disjunctive syllogism to conclude that the pen must be in the bag. The pen could still be on the desk.\n\nAnswer: no",
