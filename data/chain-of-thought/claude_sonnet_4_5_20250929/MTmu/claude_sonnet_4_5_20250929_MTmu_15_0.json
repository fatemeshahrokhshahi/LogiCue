            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step-by-step using logical reasoning.\n\nLet me define:\n- P = \"Sam took a plane\"\n- Q = \"Erin must have taken a train\"\n\nThe first statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" can be written as:\nP → Q (if P then Q)\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train\" can be written as:\n¬Q (not Q)\n\nNow I need to determine if we can infer \"Sam did not take a plane\" (¬P) from these two premises.\n\nThis is a classic application of modus tollens, which is a valid rule of inference that states:\n- If we have P → Q (if P then Q)\n- And we have ¬Q (not Q)\n- Then we can conclude ¬P (not P)\n\nThe reasoning is: If P were true, then Q would have to be true (by the first premise). But we know Q is false (from the second premise). Therefore, P must be false.\n\nIn this case:\n- If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\n- Erin did not take a train (it's not the case that she must have)\n- Therefore, Sam did not take a plane\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
