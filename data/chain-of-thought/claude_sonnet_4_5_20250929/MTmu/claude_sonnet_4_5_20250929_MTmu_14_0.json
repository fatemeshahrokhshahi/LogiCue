But we know Q is false (from the second statement). Therefore, P cannot be true, so P must be false.\n\nIn this case:\n- If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\n- The wolf was not in the den (it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den)\n- Therefore, the bear was not in the cave\n\nThis is a valid logical inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
