Modus tollens states:\n- If we have P → Q (if P then Q)\n- And we have ¬Q (not Q)\n- Then we can conclude ¬P (not P)\n\nThe reasoning is: If P were true, then Q would have to be true (by the first premise). But we know Q is false (from the second premise). Therefore, P must be false, because if P were true, it would make Q true, which contradicts what we know.\n\nApplying this to our case:\n- We have: If Tom watched football → Jen must have watched basketball\n- We know: Jen did not watch basketball\n- Therefore: Tom did not watch football\n\nAnswer: yes",
