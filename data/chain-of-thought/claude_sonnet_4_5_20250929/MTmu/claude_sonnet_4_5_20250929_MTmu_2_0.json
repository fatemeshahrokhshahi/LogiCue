Modus tollens states:\n- If we have (G → U) and ¬U, then we can conclude ¬G\n\nThe reasoning is: If G were true, then U would have to be true (by the first premise). But we know U is not true (from the second premise). Therefore, G cannot be true, so ¬G must be true.\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
