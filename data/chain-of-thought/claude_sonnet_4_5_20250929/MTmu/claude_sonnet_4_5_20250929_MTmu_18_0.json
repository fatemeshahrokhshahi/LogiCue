            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step-by-step using logical reasoning.\n\nLet me define:\n- P = \"the doll was plastic\"\n- Q = \"the truck must have been metal\"\n\nThe first statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" can be written as:\nP → Q (if P then Q)\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" can be written as:\n¬Q (not Q)\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\", which would be:\n¬P (not P)\n\nThis is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of logical inference:\n- If P → Q (if P then Q)\n- And ¬Q (not Q)\n- Then ¬P (not P)\n\nThe reasoning is: If P were true, then Q would have to be true (by the first statement). But we know Q is false (from the second statement). Therefore, P must be false.\n\nIn other words: If the doll being plastic necessarily means the truck was metal, but the truck was NOT metal, then the doll could not have been plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
