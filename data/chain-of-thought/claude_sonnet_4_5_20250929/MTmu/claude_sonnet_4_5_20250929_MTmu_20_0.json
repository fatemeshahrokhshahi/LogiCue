Modus tollens states:\n- If we have P → Q (if P then Q)\n- And we have ¬Q (not Q)\n- Then we can validly conclude ¬P (not P)\n\nThe reasoning is: If P were true, then Q would have to be true (by the first premise). But we know Q is not true (by the second premise). Therefore, P cannot be true, so P must be false.\n\nIn this case: If the apple were red, the banana would have to be yellow. But the banana is not yellow. Therefore, the apple cannot be red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
