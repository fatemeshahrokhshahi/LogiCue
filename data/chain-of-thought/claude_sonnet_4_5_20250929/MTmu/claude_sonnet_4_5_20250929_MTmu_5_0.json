            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step-by-step using logical reasoning.\n\nLet me define:\n- P = \"Jeff played basketball\"\n- Q = \"Amy must have played tennis\"\n\nThe first statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" can be written as:\nP → Q (if P then Q)\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\" can be written as:\n¬Q (not Q)\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer \"Jeff did not play basketball,\" which would be:\n¬P (not P)\n\nThis is a classic application of modus tollens, which is a valid rule of inference in logic. Modus tollens states:\n- If we have P → Q (if P then Q)\n- And we have ¬Q (not Q)\n- Then we can validly conclude ¬P (not P)\n\nThe reasoning is: If P were true, then Q would have to be true (by the first statement). But we know Q is false (from the second statement). Therefore, P must be false, because if P were true, it would make Q true, which contradicts what we know.\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
