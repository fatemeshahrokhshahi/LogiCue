Modus tollens states:\n- If we have P → Q (if P then Q)\n- And we have ¬Q (not Q)\n- Then we can validly conclude ¬P (not P)\n\nThe reasoning is: If P were true, then Q would have to be true (by the first premise). But we know Q is false (from the second premise). Therefore, P cannot be true, so P must be false.\n\nIn this case:\n- We have: If the car was red → the truck must have been blue\n- We know: The truck was not blue\n- Therefore: The car was not red\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
