            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step-by-step using logical reasoning.\n\nLet me define:\n- P = \"the cake was chocolate\"\n- Q = \"the muffins must have been blueberry\"\n\nThe first statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" can be written as:\nP → Q (if P then Q)\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\" can be written as:\n¬Q (not Q)\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\", which would be:\n¬P (not P)\n\nThis is a classic application of modus tollens, which is a valid logical inference rule that states:\n- If we have P → Q (if P then Q)\n- And we have ¬Q (not Q)\n- Then we can conclude ¬P (not P)\n\nThe reasoning is: If P were true, then Q would have to be true (by the first statement). But we know Q is false (from the second statement). Therefore, P must be false.\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
