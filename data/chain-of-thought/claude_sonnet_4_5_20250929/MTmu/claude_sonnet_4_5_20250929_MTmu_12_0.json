            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step by step using logical reasoning.\n\nLet me define:\n- P = \"Joe went to the park\"\n- Q = \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\"\n\nThe first statement gives us: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\"\nThis can be written as: P → Q (if P then Q)\n\nThe second statement gives us: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\"\nThis can be written as: ¬Q (not Q)\n\nNow I need to determine if we can infer: \"Joe did not go to the park\" (¬P)\n\nThis is a classic application of modus tollens, which is a valid form of logical inference:\n- If P → Q (if P then Q)\n- And ¬Q (not Q)\n- Then ¬P (not P)\n\nThe reasoning is: If P were true, then Q would have to be true (by the first statement). But we know Q is false (from the second statement). Therefore, P must be false, because if P were true, it would make Q true, which contradicts what we know.\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
