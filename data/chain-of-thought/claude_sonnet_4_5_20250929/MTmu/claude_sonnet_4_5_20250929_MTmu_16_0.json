            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step-by-step using logical reasoning.\n\nLet me define:\n- C = \"the shirt was cotton\"\n- D = \"the pants must have been denim\"\n\nThe first statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" can be written as:\nC → D (if C then D)\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\" can be written as:\n¬D (not D)\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton,\" which would be:\n¬C (not C)\n\nThis is a classic application of modus tollens, which is a valid rule of inference in logic. Modus tollens states:\n- If we have (C → D) and we have ¬D\n- Then we can conclude ¬C\n\nThe reasoning is: If C were true, then D would have to be true (by the first premise). But we know D is false (from the second premise). Therefore, C must be false, because if C were true, it would make D true, which contradicts what we know.\n\nThis is a valid logical inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
