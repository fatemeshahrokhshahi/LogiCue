P → Q (If P, then Q)\n2. ¬Q (Not Q)\n3. Therefore, ¬P (Therefore, not P)\n\nThe reasoning is: If P were true, then Q would have to be true (from premise 1). But we know Q is false (from premise 2). Therefore, P must be false, because if P were true, it would make Q true, which contradicts what we know.\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
