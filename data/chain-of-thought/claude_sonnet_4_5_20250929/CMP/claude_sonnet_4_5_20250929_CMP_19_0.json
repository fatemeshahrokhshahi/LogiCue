    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step by step using the given information.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. Rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less\n2. If home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most\n3. Rents likely will increase the most\n4. Hence home prices likely won't increase the most\n\nLet me denote:\n- R = rents increase the most\n- H = home prices increase the most\n- M = mortgage rates increase the most\n\nFrom premise 1 and 3: R is likely true\nFrom premise 4: H is likely false (which follows from R being likely true, since only one can increase \"the most\")\n\nPremise 2 states: ¬H → (¬R → M)\n\nNow, the question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that (¬R → M)?\n\nSince we're told that H likely won't increase the most (¬H is likely), and we have the conditional ¬H → (¬R → M), we can derive that (¬R → M) is likely true.\n\nThis is because:\n- We're told ¬H is likely true\n- We have ¬H → (¬R → M)\n- By modus ponens applied to likely statements, if ¬H is likely and ¬H → (¬R → M), then (¬R → M) is likely\n\nTherefore, yes, it does follow that it's likely that if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nAnswer: yes",
