    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me identify the key statements:\n1. Tennessee likely will add the most jobs (call this T)\n2. Georgia is projected second (G)\n3. Missouri's growth is significantly lower (M)\n4. Conditional: \"If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will\"\n   This can be written as: ¬G → (¬T → M)\n5. \"Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won't\"\n   This suggests: T is likely, and therefore ¬G is likely\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that (¬T → M)?\n\nLet me analyze the logical structure:\n- We're given: ¬G → (¬T → M)\n- This is logically equivalent to: (¬G ∧ ¬T) → M\n\nNow, we're told Georgia likely won't add the most jobs (¬G is likely), given that Tennessee likely will.\n\nThe question is whether \"if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will\" is likely.\n\nFrom the conditional ¬G → (¬T → M):\n- If we accept that ¬G is likely true (Georgia likely won't add the most)\n- Then (¬T → M) should follow from the conditional\n\nSince we're told ¬G is likely the case (because Tennessee likely will add the most, and only one can add \"the most\"), and we have the conditional ¬G → (¬T → M), then by modus ponens, (¬T → M) likely holds.\n\nTherefore, yes, it does follow that it's likely that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
