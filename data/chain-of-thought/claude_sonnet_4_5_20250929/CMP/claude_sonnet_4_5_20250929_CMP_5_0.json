    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step by step using the given information.\n\nGiven facts:\n1. Democrats likely will gain the most new voters (call this D)\n2. Republicans are second most likely (R)\n3. Libertarians trail distantly (L)\n4. Conditional: If Republicans don't gain the most voters, then if Democrats don't, Libertarians will. In logical form: ¬R → (¬D → L)\n5. Democrats likely will gain the most voters, so Republicans likely won't (D is likely, so ¬R is likely)\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that it is likely that (if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will)? In other words, is (¬D → L) likely?\n\nFrom fact 4, we have: ¬R → (¬D → L)\n\nThis means: If Republicans don't gain the most voters, then the conditional (¬D → L) holds.\n\nFrom fact 5, we know that ¬R is likely (Republicans likely won't gain the most voters).\n\nNow, if ¬R is likely true, and we have ¬R → (¬D → L), then by modus ponens, (¬D → L) is likely true.\n\nIn other words: Since it's likely that Republicans won't gain the most voters, and we know that if Republicans don't gain the most voters then \"if Democrats don't gain the most, Libertarians will,\" it follows that it's likely that \"if Democrats don't gain the most, Libertarians will.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
