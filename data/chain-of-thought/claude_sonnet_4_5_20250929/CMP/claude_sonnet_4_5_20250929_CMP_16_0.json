    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\n\nLet me work through this step by step, using the logical structure provided.\n\nGiven information:\n1. Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the only major transportation providers\n2. Uber likely will have the most rides (most probable)\n3. Lyft is second most likely\n4. Taxis have significantly fewer rides (least likely)\n5. Key conditional: \"If Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides\"\n6. Since Uber likely gives the most rides, Lyft likely won't give the most rides\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that \"if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will\"?\n\nLet me parse the conditional in statement 5:\n- If ¬Lyft_most → (If ¬Uber_most → Taxis_most)\n- This is logically equivalent to: (¬Lyft_most ∧ ¬Uber_most) → Taxis_most\n\nFrom statement 6, we know Lyft likely won't give the most rides (¬Lyft_most is likely true).\n\nNow, given that ¬Lyft_most is likely true, the conditional simplifies:\n- If ¬Lyft_most is true, then: ¬Uber_most → Taxis_most\n\nSo the question becomes: Is it likely that (¬Uber_most → Taxis_most)?\n\nSince we're told ¬Lyft_most is likely true, and we have the conditional (¬Lyft_most ∧ ¬Uber_most) → Taxis_most, this means that in the likely scenario where Lyft doesn't give the most rides, IF Uber also doesn't give the most rides, THEN taxis must give the most rides (since these are the only three options).\n\nTherefore, it is likely that the conditional \"if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will\" holds true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
