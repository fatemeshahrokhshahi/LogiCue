    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step by step using the information provided.\n\nGiven facts:\n1. Only three candidates: Priya, Julian, and Diego\n2. Priya is most likely, Julian second, Diego is a longshot\n3. \"If Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will\"\n4. It's likely Priya will get the offer (and hence Julian won't)\n\nThe key statement is: \"If Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will.\"\n\nThis can be written as: ¬Julian → (¬Priya → Diego)\n\nThis is logically equivalent to: (¬Julian ∧ ¬Priya) → Diego\n\nNow, the question asks: Is it likely that (if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will)?\nIn other words: Is \"¬Priya → Diego\" likely?\n\nFor ¬Priya → Diego to be true, we need Diego to get the offer whenever Priya doesn't.\n\nSince only one person gets the offer, if Priya doesn't get it, either Julian or Diego must get it.\n\nFrom statement 3: If Julian doesn't get the offer, then (if Priya doesn't get it, Diego will).\n\nBut what if Julian DOES get the offer? Then Priya doesn't get it, but Diego doesn't either - Julian does.\n\nSince we're told Priya is most likely and Diego is a longshot, in the scenario where Priya doesn't get the offer, Julian (being second most likely) would be more probable to get it than Diego.\n\nTherefore, \"if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will\" is NOT likely - it's more likely Julian would get it in that case.\n\nAnswer: no",
