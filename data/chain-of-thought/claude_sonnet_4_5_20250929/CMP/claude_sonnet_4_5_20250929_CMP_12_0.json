    "user_prompt": "Suppose that thrillers, romances, and mysteries are the top-selling fiction genres. Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren’t #1, then if thrillers aren’t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if thrillers aren’t #1, mysteries will be?",

If romances aren't #1, then if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be\n3. Thrillers likely will lead sales, and hence romances likely won't be #1\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that, if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be?\n\nLet me denote:\n- T = thrillers are #1\n- R = romances are #1\n- M = mysteries are #1\n\nFrom premise 2: ¬R → (¬T → M), which is logically equivalent to: ¬R → (T ∨ M)\n\nFrom premises 1 and 3: It's likely that T (thrillers are #1), and likely that ¬R (romances aren't #1)\n\nNow, the question asks whether: likely(¬T → M)?\n\nFrom premise 2, we have: ¬R → (¬T → M)\n\nIf we know that ¬R is likely true (which we do from premise 3), then we can infer that (¬T → M) is likely true, because:\n- When ¬R is true, the conditional ¬R → (¬T → M) tells us that (¬T → M) must be true\n- Since ¬R is likely, (¬T → M) is likely\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
