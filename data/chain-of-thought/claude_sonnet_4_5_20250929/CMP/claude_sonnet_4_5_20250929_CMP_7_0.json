    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it’s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

These are the only three major sources (so exactly one must generate the most)\n2. It's likely that T (tidal power will generate the most)\n3. The ranking is likely: T > S > W\n4. \"If S doesn't generate the most, then if T doesn't, W will\" - this is: ¬S → (¬T → W)\n5. \"T is likely, hence S likely won't\" - this suggests: likely(T) and likely(¬S)\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that (¬T → W)?\n\nLet me analyze the conditional ¬S → (¬T → W):\n- This is logically equivalent to: ¬S → (T ∨ W)\n- Which is equivalent to: S ∨ T ∨ W\n\nSince exactly one of {T, S, W} must be true (only one can generate the most), we know S ∨ T ∨ W is always true. So statement 4 is actually a tautology given the constraint.\n\nNow, given that:\n- Exactly one of {T, S, W} generates the most electricity\n- It's likely that T\n- Therefore it's likely that ¬S and likely that ¬W\n\nThe question asks about: likely(¬T → W)\n\nThe conditional ¬T → W means: \"if tidal doesn't generate the most, then wind does.\"\n\nGiven that exactly one must generate the most:\n- If ¬T is true, then either S or W must be true\n- We're told it's likely S > W in capacity\n- So if T doesn't win, S is more likely than W to win\n\nTherefore, ¬T → W is not necessarily likely to be true. In fact, if ¬T occurs, S would be more likely than W.\n\nHowever, we know likely(T), which means likely(T ∨ (",
