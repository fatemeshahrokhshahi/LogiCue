    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it’s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be. Moreover, it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

Apples are likely to be the top seller\n2. Bananas follow closely behind apples\n3. Oranges trail distantly behind\n4. These three are by far the top-selling fruits\n5. \"If bananas aren't the top seller, then if apples aren't, oranges will be\" - This gives us: ¬B → (¬A → O)\n6. \"It's likely apples will be top and hence bananas won't be\" - This suggests: Likely(A) and Likely(¬B)\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that it is likely that (if apples aren't top, oranges will be)? In other words: Is Likely(¬A → O) true?\n\nLet me analyze the conditional in statement 5: ¬B → (¬A → O)\nThis is logically equivalent to: ¬B → (A ∨ O)\nOr equivalently: B ∨ A ∨ O (at least one of them is top seller)\n\nNow, we're told:\n- Likely(A) - apples likely to be top\n- Bananas follow \"closely\" behind apples\n- Oranges trail \"distantly\" behind\n\nGiven that bananas are close to apples but we're told it's likely apples will be top (and hence bananas won't be), this suggests that while bananas have a reasonable probability, it's still more likely to be apples.\n\nThe key question: In the scenario where apples aren't top (¬A), what happens?\n\nIf ¬A, then either B or O must be top (from statement 5, given that one of the three must be top).\n\nSince bananas \"closely follow\" apples while oranges \"trail distantly,\" in the possible worlds where apples aren't top, bananas would be much more likely to be top than oranges.\n\nTherefore, ¬A → O is not likely to be true. Rather, ¬A → B would be more likely.\n\nSo Likely(¬A → O) does not follow from",
