    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step by step.\n\nGiven information:\n1. India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies (and by far the biggest)\n2. Economists project India will likely grow fastest, followed by China, with Russia lagging far behind\n3. \"If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn't, Russia will be\"\n4. India's economy likely will grow the fastest, hence China's likely won't\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that \"if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be\"?\n\nLet me analyze the conditional in statement 3: \"If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn't, Russia will be.\"\n\nThis can be written as: ¬China_top → (¬India_top → Russia_top)\n\nNow, we're told it's likely that India will be the top-growing economy. This means it's likely that China won't be top (statement 4 confirms this).\n\nSo it's likely that ¬China_top is true.\n\nGiven that ¬China_top is likely true, and we have the conditional ¬China_top → (¬India_top → Russia_top), we can derive that it's likely that (¬India_top → Russia_top).\n\nThis is exactly what the question asks about: \"if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be.\"\n\nSince these are the only three major emerging economies mentioned, and we're told they are \"by far the biggest,\" one of them must be the top-growing emerging economy. The conditional logic combined with the likelihood that China won't be top means that the conditional \"if India isn't top, Russia will be\" is likely true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
