            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\"\n- In logical form: If A, then C (A → C)\n\nWe're asked whether we can infer: \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\"\n- In logical form: If not C, then not A (¬C → ¬A)\n\nIn classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The contrapositive of \"If A, then C\" is formed by:\n1. Negating both parts\n2. Reversing their order\n\nSo the contrapositive of (A → C) is (¬C → ¬A).\n\nSince a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" we can validly infer \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
