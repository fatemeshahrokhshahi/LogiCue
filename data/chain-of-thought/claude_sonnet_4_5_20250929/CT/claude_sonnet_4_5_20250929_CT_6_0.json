            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\"\nThis can be written in logical form as: If P, then Q\nWhere P = \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q = \"Bob chose pasta\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\"\n\nA fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTo see why this makes sense intuitively: If we know that Sue choosing pizza guarantees Bob chose pasta, then if Bob didn't choose pasta, Sue couldn't have chosen pizza (because if she had, Bob would have had to choose pasta according to our original rule).\n\nTherefore, yes, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
