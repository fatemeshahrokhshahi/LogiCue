            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n- Let P = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\n- Let Q = \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n- Original form: If P, then Q (P → Q)\n\nThe question asks if we can infer: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\"\n- This would be: If not Q, then not P (¬Q → ¬P)\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement (P → Q) is (¬Q → ¬P), and the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means:\n- If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true\n- If the original statement is false, the contrapositive must also be false\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
