            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nIn logical form: If G → U (where G = \"griffin was in the forest\" and U = \"unicorn was in the forest\")\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P.\"\n\nSo the contrapositive of \"If G → U\" is \"If not U → not G\"\n\nIn words: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nA fundamental rule of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must be true, and if one is false, the other must be false.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement, we can validly infer its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
