            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\nIn logical form: If P, then Q (where P = \"shirt was cotton\" and Q = \"pants were denim\")\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nFor our statement, the contrapositive would be: \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nIn classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, yes, from \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" we can validly infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
