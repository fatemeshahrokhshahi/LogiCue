            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement. Let me work through this step by step.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\"\n- Let P = \"the alien visited Mars\"\n- Let Q = \"the robot visited Jupiter\"\n- Original form: If P, then Q (P → Q)\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\"\n- This translates to: If not Q, then not P (¬Q → ¬P)\n\nIn classical logic, a conditional statement (P → Q) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (¬Q → ¬P). This is a fundamental logical principle.\n\nTo verify: \n- P → Q means \"whenever P is true, Q must be true\"\n- ¬Q → ¬P means \"whenever Q is false, P must be false\"\n\nThese express the same logical relationship. If we know that P being true guarantees Q is true, then we also know that Q being false guarantees P is false (because if P were true, Q would have to be true, contradicting our assumption that Q is false).\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive is a valid inference from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
