The contrapositive of \"If M, then S\" is formed by:\n1. Negating both the antecedent (M) and consequent (S)\n2. Swapping their positions\n\nSo the contrapositive of (M → S) is (¬S → ¬M)\n\nSince a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" we can validly infer \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
