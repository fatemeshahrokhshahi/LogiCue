            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\"\nThis can be written in logical form as: If P, then Q\nWhere P = \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q = \"Kate ate the salad\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\"\n\nA fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad,\" we can validly infer \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
