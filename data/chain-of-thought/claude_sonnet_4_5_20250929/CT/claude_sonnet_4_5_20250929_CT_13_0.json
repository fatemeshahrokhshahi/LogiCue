            "content": "Explanation: This question asks about a logical inference known as the contrapositive. Let me work through this step by step.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n- Let P = \"the car was red\"\n- Let Q = \"the truck was blue\"\n- Original form: If P, then Q (P → Q)\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\"\n- This translates to: If not Q, then not P (~Q → ~P)\n\nIn classical logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This is a fundamental rule of inference.\n\nTo see why this works:\n- If P → Q is true, this means whenever P is true, Q must be true\n- So if Q is false (not blue), then P cannot be true (because if P were true, Q would have to be true)\n- Therefore, if Q is false, P must be false\n\nThe contrapositive (~Q → ~P) is logically equivalent to the original statement (P → Q), meaning they always have the same truth value.\n\nAnswer: yes",
