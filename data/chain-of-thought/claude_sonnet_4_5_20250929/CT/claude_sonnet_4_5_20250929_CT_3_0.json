            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nIn logical form: If P, then Q\nWhere P = \"the book was written by James\"\nAnd Q = \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nA fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement, we can validly infer its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
