            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\nThis can be written in logical form as: If P, then Q\nWhere P = \"the doll was plastic\" and Q = \"the truck was metal\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\"\n\nA fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" we can validly infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
