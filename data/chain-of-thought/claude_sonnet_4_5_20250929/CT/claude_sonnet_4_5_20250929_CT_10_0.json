A fundamental rule of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value.\n\nSo from \"If D then C\" we can validly infer \"If not C then not D\"\n\nIn plain English: If we know that \"dog inside → cat outside\" is true, then we can be certain that \"cat NOT outside → dog NOT inside\" is also true.\n\nThis is because if the cat was not outside, but the dog was inside, this would contradict our original rule (which states that the dog being inside necessitates the cat being outside).\n\nAnswer: yes",
