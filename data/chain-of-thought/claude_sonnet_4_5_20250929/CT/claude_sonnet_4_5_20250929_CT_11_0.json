            "content": "Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement. Let me work through this step by step.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\"\n- Let P = \"the cake was chocolate\"\n- Let Q = \"the muffins were blueberry\"\n- Original form: P → Q (If P, then Q)\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\"\n- This would be: ¬Q → ¬P (If not Q, then not P)\n\nIn classical logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement (P → Q) is (¬Q → ¬P), and the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This is a fundamental rule of inference.\n\nTo verify: \n- If P → Q is true, then whenever P is true, Q must be true\n- This means if Q is false, P cannot be true (otherwise we'd have a contradiction)\n- Therefore, ¬Q → ¬P must also be true\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, we can validly infer it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
