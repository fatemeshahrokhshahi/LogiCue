            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\"\nThis can be written in logical form as: If P, then Q\nWhere P = \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q = \"Amy played tennis\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\"\n\nA fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" we can validly infer \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
