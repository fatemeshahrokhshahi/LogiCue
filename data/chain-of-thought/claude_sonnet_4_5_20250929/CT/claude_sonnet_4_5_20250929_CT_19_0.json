            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\"\nThis can be written as: If P, then Q\nWhere P = \"Tom watched football\" and Q = \"Jen watched basketball\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\"\n\nA fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we can validly infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
