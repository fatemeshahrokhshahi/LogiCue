            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\"\nThis can be written as: If P, then Q\nWhere P = \"Sam took a plane\" and Q = \"Erin took a train\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\"\n\nIn classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train,\" we can validly infer \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
