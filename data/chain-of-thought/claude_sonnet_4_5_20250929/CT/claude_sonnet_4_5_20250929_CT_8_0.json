            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nIn logical form: If V, then M (where V = vampire was awake, M = mummy was awake)\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nFor our statement:\n- Original: If V, then M\n- Contrapositive: If not M, then not V\n\nIn words: \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nA fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" we can validly infer \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
