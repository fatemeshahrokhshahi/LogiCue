            "content": "Explanation: This question asks about a logical inference pattern known as contraposition. Let me work through this step by step.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n- Let P = \"the apple was red\"\n- Let Q = \"the banana was yellow\"\n- Original form: If P, then Q (P → Q)\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\"\n- This translates to: If not Q, then not P (¬Q → ¬P)\n\nIn classical logic, contraposition is a valid inference rule. This means that a conditional statement (P → Q) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (¬Q → ¬P). They always have the same truth value.\n\nTo see why this works: If we assume P → Q is true, and we also assume the banana was not yellow (¬Q), then the apple could not have been red (¬P). Why? Because if the apple had been red (P), then by our original statement, the banana would have been yellow (Q), which contradicts our assumption that the banana was not yellow.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive is a valid logical inference from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
