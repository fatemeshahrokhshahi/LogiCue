            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\n- Let P = \"Joe went to the park\"\n- Let Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n- Original form: If P, then Q (P → Q)\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer: \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\"\n- This would be: If not Q, then not P (¬Q → ¬P)\n\nIn classical logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. They have the same truth value.\n\nTherefore, from \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" we can validly infer \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
