            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step-by-step using logical reasoning.\n\nLet me define:\n- M = \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n- S = \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" = M → S\n2. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" = ◇¬S (it's possible that Sue was not at the wedding)\n\nThe question asks: Can we infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (¬M)?\n\nFrom premise 1 (M → S), we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there. The contrapositive of this statement is: ¬S → ¬M (if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nHowever, premise 2 only tells us that Sue *might not* have been at the wedding - this expresses possibility, not actuality. It doesn't tell us that Sue definitely was not at the wedding, only that it's possible she wasn't.\n\nThe possibility that Sue was not at the wedding (◇¬S) does not allow us to conclude with certainty that Sue was not at the wedding (¬S). And without knowing for certain that Sue was not at the wedding, we cannot use the contrapositive to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nIn modal logic terms, from M → S and ◇¬S, we can only infer ◇¬M (Mary might not have been at the wedding), not ¬M (Mary was definitely not at the wedding).\n\nAnswer: no",
