It doesn't definitively state that R is false; it only says it's possible that R is false.\n\nIf we only know that ~R is possible (not certain), we cannot definitively conclude ~A. We would need to know with certainty that R is false to conclude that A is false.\n\nHowever, if we interpret this in terms of logical consistency: given that the first statement establishes a necessary connection (A → R must hold), and the second statement says R might be false, then for both statements to be consistent, A must not be true (otherwise R would have to be true, contradicting the possibility that R is false).\n\nIn modal logic terms, if R must be true when A is true, but R might be false, then A cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
