This is equivalent to saying: either P is false or Q is true (¬P ∨ Q).\n\nIf \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" (¬Q is possible), this means we cannot guarantee that Q is true.\n\nBut wait - if P were true, then by P → Q, Q would have to be true (it would be necessary, not just possible). However, we're told that Q might not be true (¬Q is possible).\n\nThis creates a contradiction if P were true. Therefore, P cannot be true.\n\nIn other words: If Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (by the first statement). But since Bob might not have chosen pasta, Sue could not have chosen pizza.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
