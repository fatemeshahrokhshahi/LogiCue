This is a modal statement about possibility, not a definite statement about what is actually the case.\n\nBut if we interpret this in a logical system where \"must\" indicates necessity and \"might not\" indicates the possibility of negation, then \"might not have been blue\" contradicts \"must have been blue\" when the antecedent is true. This means R cannot be true, because if R were true, B must be true, which contradicts the possibility that B is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
