This is equivalent to saying: either ¬P or S (either Ben didn't eat pasta, or Kate ate salad).\n\nThe statement \"Kate might not have eaten salad\" tells us that ¬S is possible - meaning we cannot be certain that S is true.\n\nIf we cannot be certain that S is true (Kate ate salad), and we know that P → S (if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad), then we cannot be certain that P is true either. Because if P were definitely true, then S would have to be definitely true (by modus ponens), which contradicts the possibility that S is false.\n\nHowever, \"might not have eaten salad\" doesn't mean Kate definitely didn't eat salad - it just means it's possible she didn't. This doesn't give us enough information to conclude definitively that Ben did not eat pasta. We can only conclude that Ben might not have eaten pasta, or that we cannot be certain Ben ate pasta.\n\nTo definitively conclude \"Ben did not eat pasta,\" we would need \"Kate did not eat salad\" (not just \"might not have\"), which would allow us to use modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: no",
