This is different from definitively stating \"The cat was not outside.\"\n\nFor us to definitively infer \"The dog was not inside,\" we would need to know with certainty that \"The cat was not outside.\" But we only know that the cat *might* not have been outside - this is a statement about possibility, not actuality.\n\nSince we only have information about what's possible (not what's actually true), we cannot make a definitive inference about whether the dog was inside or not. We can only say that it's possible the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
