This indicates that it's possible that the book is not a mystery novel - in other words, we cannot be certain that the book IS a mystery novel.\n\nIf we know that \"If J then M\" (if James wrote it, it must be a mystery), and we know that it's possible the book is not a mystery novel, what can we conclude about whether James wrote it?\n\nIf James had written the book, then by the first statement, the book MUST be a mystery novel - it would be certain. But the second statement tells us it's not certain that the book is a mystery novel (it might not be one). \n\nThis creates a logical conflict if James wrote the book. Therefore, James could not have written the book.\n\nThis is essentially using modus tollens: from \"If J then M\" and \"possibly not M\" (which means we can't affirm M with certainty), we can infer that J cannot be true with certainty. In fact, given that J would necessitate M, and M is not necessary, J must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
