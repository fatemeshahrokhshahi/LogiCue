It doesn't definitively state that the banana was not yellow; it only says it's possible that it wasn't yellow.\n\nIf we knew for certain that ¬Y (the banana was definitely not yellow), then by modus tollens we could conclude ¬R (the apple was not red).\n\nBut since we only know that ¬Y is possible (not that it's actually true), we cannot definitively conclude ¬R. The possibility that the banana wasn't yellow is consistent with the apple not being red, but it doesn't prove it.\n\nAnswer: no",
