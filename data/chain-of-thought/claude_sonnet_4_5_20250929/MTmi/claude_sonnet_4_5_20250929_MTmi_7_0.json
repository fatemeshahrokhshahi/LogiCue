We would need the categorical statement \"Chris did not finish the race\" (¬C) to apply modus tollens and conclude ¬A.\n\nSince we only have \"Chris might not have finished\" rather than \"Chris did not finish,\" we cannot definitively infer that Alex did not finish the race. The modal qualifier \"might\" indicates possibility, not actuality, so we cannot make the definitive inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
