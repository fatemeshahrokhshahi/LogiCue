            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step-by-step using logical reasoning.\n\nLet me define:\n- P = \"the doll was plastic\"\n- M = \"the truck was metal\"\n\nThe first statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" can be written as:\nP → M (if P then M)\n\nThe second statement \"The truck might not have been metal\" means:\nIt's possible that ~M (it's possible that the truck was not metal)\n\nNow, I need to determine if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" (~P).\n\nFrom classical logic, if we have P → M, and we know ~M (the truck was NOT metal), then by modus tollens we can conclude ~P (the doll was NOT plastic).\n\nHowever, the second statement only says the truck \"might not have been metal\" - this expresses possibility, not certainty. This means ~M is possible, but not necessarily true.\n\nThe key question is: Does the possibility that ~M, combined with P → M, allow us to infer ~P with certainty?\n\nNo, it doesn't. The second statement only tells us that ~M is possible, not that ~M is actually true. For modus tollens to work, we need to know definitively that ~M is true, not just possible.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The doll was not plastic\" from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
