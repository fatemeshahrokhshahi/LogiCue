            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step-by-step using logical reasoning.\n\nLet me define:\n- R = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\n- B = \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\nThe first statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" can be written as:\nR → B (if R then B)\n\nThe second statement \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" indicates that it's possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, which means we cannot confirm that B is true. In fact, this suggests that ~B (not B) is possible or even likely.\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer:\n\nFrom R → B, we know that:\n- If R is true, then B must be true\n- Equivalently (by contrapositive): If B is false (~B), then R must be false (~R)\n\nGiven that \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" suggests ~B is the case (or at least possible), we can apply modus tollens:\n- If ~B (Mark did not buy the blue shirt)\n- And R → B (the conditional from statement 1)\n- Then ~R (Lisa did not buy the red shirt)\n\nSince the second statement indicates Mark might not have (or didn't) buy the blue shirt, we can indeed infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
