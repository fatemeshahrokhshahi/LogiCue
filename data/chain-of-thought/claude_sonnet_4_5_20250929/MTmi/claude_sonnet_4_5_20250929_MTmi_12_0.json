            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step-by-step using logical reasoning.\n\nLet me define:\n- P = \"Joe went to the park\"\n- Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\nThe first statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" can be written as:\nP → Q (if P then Q)\n\nThe second statement \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" means:\nIt's possible that ¬Q (it's possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo)\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer:\n\nFrom P → Q, we know that:\n- If P is true, then Q must be true\n- Equivalently (by contrapositive): If Q is false (¬Q), then P must be false (¬P)\n\nThe second statement tells us that ¬Q is possible (Lucy might not have gone to the zoo).\n\nIf Lucy did not go to the zoo (¬Q is true), then by the contrapositive of our first statement, Joe did not go to the park (¬P must be true).\n\nHowever, the second statement only says it's *possible* that Lucy didn't go to the zoo, not that she definitely didn't. This means we're dealing with possibility rather than certainty.\n\nBut the question asks if we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" - this would be a definite conclusion. Since we only know it's *possible* that Lucy didn't go to the zoo, we can only conclude it's *possible* that Joe didn't go to the park, not that he definitely didn't.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
