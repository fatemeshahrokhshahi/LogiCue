This is weaker than saying the mummy definitely was not awake (¬M).\n\nThe modal statement \"might not have been awake\" indicates possibility, not actuality. It doesn't establish that the mummy was definitely not awake - only that it's possible the mummy wasn't awake.\n\nTo validly infer \"The vampire was not awake,\" we would need to know definitively that \"The mummy was not awake.\" But we only know that the mummy might not have been awake, which is compatible with the mummy actually being awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make this inference with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
