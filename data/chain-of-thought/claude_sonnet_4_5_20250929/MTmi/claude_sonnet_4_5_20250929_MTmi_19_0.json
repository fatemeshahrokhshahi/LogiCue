            "content": "Explanation: Let me work through this step by step using logical reasoning.\n\nLet me define:\n- P = \"Tom watched football\"\n- Q = \"Jen watched basketball\"\n\nThe first statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" can be written as:\nP → Q (if P then Q)\n\nThe second statement \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" means:\nIt's possible that ¬Q (it's possible that Jen did not watch basketball)\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer:\n\nFrom P → Q, we know that whenever P is true, Q must be true. This is equivalent to saying: either ¬P or Q (either Tom didn't watch football, or Jen watched basketball).\n\nThe second statement tells us that ¬Q is possible (Jen might not have watched basketball).\n\nIf we're in a scenario where ¬Q is actually true (Jen did not watch basketball), then from P → Q, we can deduce that P must be false (Tom did not watch football). This is because if P were true, then Q would have to be true (by modus ponens), but we're assuming Q is false. This is the contrapositive: ¬Q → ¬P.\n\nHowever, the second statement only says it's *possible* that Jen didn't watch basketball, not that she definitely didn't. But the first statement says Jen *must have* watched basketball if Tom watched football. The word \"must\" indicates necessity.\n\nIf Tom watched football, then Jen necessarily watched basketball. But we're told Jen might not have watched basketball (it's possible she didn't). These two statements together imply that Tom did not watch football, because if he had, there would be no possibility of Jen not watching basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
