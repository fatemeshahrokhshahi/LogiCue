It doesn't definitively state that the muffins were NOT blueberry.\n\nIf we knew for certain that ¬B (the muffins were definitely not blueberry), then we could use modus tollens to conclude ¬C (the cake was not chocolate).\n\nBut since we only know that ¬B is possible (not certain), we cannot definitively conclude ¬C. The cake might or might not have been chocolate - we cannot make a definitive inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
