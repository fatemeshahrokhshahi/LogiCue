The rule states:\n- If we have (P or Q)\n- And we know that Q is false (¬Q)\n- Then we can conclude P must be true\n\nSince we know either P or Q is true (from premise 1), and we know Q is false (from premise 2), then P must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can validly infer that \"the shoes are in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
