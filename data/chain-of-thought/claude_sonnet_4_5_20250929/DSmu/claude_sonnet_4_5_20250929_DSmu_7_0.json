The rule states:\n- If we have (P ∨ Q) and we also have ¬Q, then we can conclude P.\n\nIn other words, if we know that at least one of two options must be true (the umbrella is either in the car OR in the closet), and we then learn that one of those options is false (it's NOT in the closet), we can validly conclude that the other option must be true (it IS in the car).\n\nThis is a valid deductive inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
