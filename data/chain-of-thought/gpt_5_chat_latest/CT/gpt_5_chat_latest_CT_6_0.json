A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent — they always have the same truth value.  \n\nThe statement we are asked about is \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza,\" which translates to ¬Q → ¬P. This is exactly the contrapositive of the original statement.  \n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer it from the original statement.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
