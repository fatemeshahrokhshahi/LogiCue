            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe given statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" In logical form, this can be written as:  \nT → J  \n(where T = \"Tom watched football\" and J = \"Jen watched basketball\").  \n\nThe question asks whether we can infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football,\" which is:  \n¬J → ¬T  \n\nThis new statement is the *contrapositive* of the original statement. In logic, a conditional statement (T → J) is *logically equivalent* to its contrapositive (¬J → ¬T). That means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.  \n\nTherefore, from \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we can indeed infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"  \n\nAnswer: yes",
