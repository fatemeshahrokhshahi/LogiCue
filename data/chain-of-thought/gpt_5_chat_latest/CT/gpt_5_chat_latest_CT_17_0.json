A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent — they always have the same truth value. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nHence, we can indeed infer \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
