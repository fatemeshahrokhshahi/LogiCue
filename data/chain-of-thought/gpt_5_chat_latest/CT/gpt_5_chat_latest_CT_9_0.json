            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe original statement is a conditional: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" Symbolically, this can be written as:  \nL → M  \n(where L = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and M = \"Mark bought the blue shirt\").  \n\nThe question asks whether we can infer: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" Symbolically, that is:  \n¬M → ¬L  \n\nThis new statement is the *contrapositive* of the original conditional. In logic, a conditional statement (P → Q) is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive (¬Q → ¬P). Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
