            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe given statement is a conditional: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" In logical form, this can be written as:  \nP → Q  \nwhere P = \"Joe went to the park\" and Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P (\"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\"). A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent — they always have the same truth value.  \n\nTherefore, from \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" we can indeed infer \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"  \n\nAnswer: yes",
