A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent — they always have the same truth value.  \n\nTherefore, from \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" we can indeed infer \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"  \n\nAnswer: yes",
