            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" Symbolically, this can be written as \\( R \\rightarrow B \\).  \n2. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg B \\).  \n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have \\( R \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can apply *modus tollens*, which allows us to infer \\( \\neg R \\) (the negation of the antecedent).  \n\nThus, from these two premises, we can validly conclude that the car was not red.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
