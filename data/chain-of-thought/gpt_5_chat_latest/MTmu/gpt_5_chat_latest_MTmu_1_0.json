            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" Symbolically, this can be written as \\( M \\rightarrow S \\).  \n2. \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg S \\).  \n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\), we can apply *modus tollens*, which allows us to infer \\( \\neg M \\) (the negation of the antecedent).  \n\nThus, from these two premises, we can validly infer that Mary was not at the wedding.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
