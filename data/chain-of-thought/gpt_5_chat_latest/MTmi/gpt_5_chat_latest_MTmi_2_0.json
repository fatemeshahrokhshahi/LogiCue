            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. *If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.*  \n   Symbolically: \\( G \\rightarrow U \\).  \n2. *The unicorn might not have been in the forest.*  \n   This means it is possible that \\( \\neg U \\) (the unicorn was not in the forest). It does **not** assert that \\( \\neg U \\) is true, only that it is possible.\n\nTo infer *The griffin was not in the forest* (\\( \\neg G \\)), we would need to know that \\( \\neg U \\) is actually true, because from \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\), we can validly infer \\( \\neg G \\) (modus tollens).  \nHowever, since we only know that \\( \\neg U \\) is *possible* (not certain), we cannot conclude \\( \\neg G \\) with certainty. The information given only allows that \\( \\neg G \\) *might* be true, not that it *is* true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest.  \n\nAnswer: no",
