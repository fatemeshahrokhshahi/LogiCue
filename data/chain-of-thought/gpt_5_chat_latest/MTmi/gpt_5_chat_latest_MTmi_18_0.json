            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"  \n   This can be represented logically as:  \n   \\( P \\rightarrow M \\)  \n   (If the doll was plastic (P), then the truck was metal (M)).  \n\n2. \"The truck might not have been metal.\"  \n   This means it is *possible* that the truck was not metal — in other words, we do not know for sure that \\( M \\) is true; \\( \\neg M \\) is possible.  \n\nNow, to infer \"The doll was not plastic\" (\\( \\neg P \\)), we would need to know that \\( M \\) is *definitely* false, because from \\( P \\rightarrow M \\), if \\( M \\) is false, then \\( P \\) must also be false (by contrapositive reasoning).  \n\nHowever, the second statement only says that the truck *might not* have been metal — it does not assert that it *was not* metal. Since we only have uncertainty about \\( M \\), we cannot conclude \\( \\neg P \\) with certainty.  \n\nTherefore, the inference \"The doll was not plastic\" does **not** logically follow.  \n\nAnswer: no",
