            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" can be written logically as:  \n**Mary → Sue** (If Mary, then Sue).  \n\nThe second statement, \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" means that it is *possible* that Sue was not there — in other words, we do not know for sure that Sue was there. This expresses uncertainty about Sue’s attendance, not a definite claim that she wasn’t there.  \n\nTo infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (¬Mary), we would need to know that Sue was *definitely* not at the wedding (¬Sue). From the conditional **Mary → Sue**, if we knew ¬Sue, we could validly infer ¬Mary (by contrapositive reasoning).  \n\nHowever, since we only know that Sue *might not* have been there — not that she *was not* there — we cannot draw a definite conclusion about Mary. The information given is insufficient to infer that Mary was not at the wedding.  \n\nAnswer: no",
