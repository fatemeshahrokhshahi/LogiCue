            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n\n1. **If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.**  \n   This can be written logically as:  \n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\),  \n   where \\( P \\) = \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) = \"Bob chose pasta.\"  \n\n2. **Bob might not have chosen pasta.**  \n   This means it is *possible* that \\( \\neg Q \\) (Bob did not choose pasta). It does not assert \\( \\neg Q \\) as true, only that it’s possible.  \n\nNow, to infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\" (\\( \\neg P \\)), we would need to know that \\( \\neg Q \\) is *actually true*, not just possible. The rule of contrapositive says that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), then \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). But since we only know that \\( \\neg Q \\) is *possible*, not that it *is* the case, we cannot conclude \\( \\neg P \\).  \n\nTherefore, the inference \"Sue did not choose pizza\" does **not** logically follow from the given information.  \n\nAnswer: no",
