            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball,\" can be represented logically as:  \nIf T (Tom watched football), then J (Jen watched basketball).  \nSymbolically: T → J.  \n\nThe second statement, \"Jen might not have watched basketball,\" means that it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball — in other words, ¬J is possible.  \n\nFrom T → J, the contrapositive is ¬J → ¬T.  \nIf we knew for sure that Jen did not watch basketball (¬J), then we could conclude that Tom did not watch football (¬T).  \n\nHowever, the statement \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" does not assert ¬J; it only says that ¬J is possible. Possibility does not entail actuality. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Tom did not watch football — only that it’s possible he didn’t.  \n\nAnswer: no",
