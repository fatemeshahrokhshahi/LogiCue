Only then, by modus tollens, could we conclude \\( \\neg J \\) from \\( J \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nHowever, the statement \"might not be a mystery novel\" does not assert \\( \\neg M \\); it only expresses uncertainty about \\( M \\). Therefore, we cannot logically infer \\( \\neg J \\) from these premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
