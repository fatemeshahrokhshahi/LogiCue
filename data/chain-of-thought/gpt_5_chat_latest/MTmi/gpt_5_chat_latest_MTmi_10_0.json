            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside,\" can be represented logically as:  \nIf D (dog inside), then C (cat outside). Symbolically: D → C.  \n\nThe second statement, \"The cat might not have been outside,\" means that it is possible that the cat was not outside — in other words, we cannot be certain that C is true; ¬C is possible.  \n\nFrom D → C, the contrapositive is ¬C → ¬D. This means that if the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.  \n\nHowever, the second statement does not assert that ¬C is true; it only says that ¬C is possible. Since we do not know for sure that ¬C actually holds, we cannot conclude that ¬D (the dog was not inside) must be true.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the dog was not inside.  \n\nAnswer: no",
