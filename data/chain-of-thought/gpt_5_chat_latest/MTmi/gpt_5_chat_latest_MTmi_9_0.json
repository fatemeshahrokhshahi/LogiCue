            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" can be represented logically as:  \nIf L, then M.  \n\nThe second statement, \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt,\" means that it is possible that M is false — in other words, we do not know for sure that M is true.  \n\nTo infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (¬L), we would need to know that M is definitely false, because from \"If L then M\" and \"not M,\" we can validly infer \"not L\" (this is the contrapositive).  \n\nHowever, the second statement only says that M *might not* be true — it does not assert that M is false. Since we only have uncertainty about M, we cannot conclude with certainty that L is false.  \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.  \n\nAnswer: no",
