            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue,\" can be represented logically as:  \nIf \\( C \\) (car was red), then \\( T \\) (truck was blue).  \nSymbolically: \\( C \\rightarrow T \\).\n\nThe second statement, \"The truck might not have been blue,\" means that it is possible that \\( T \\) is false — in other words, we do not know for sure that \\( T \\) is true. This expresses uncertainty about \\( T \\), not a definite claim that \\( T \\) is false.\n\nTo infer \"The car was not red\" (¬\\( C \\)), we would need to know that \\( T \\) is definitely false, because from \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) and ¬\\( T \\), we can validly infer ¬\\( C \\) (this is the contrapositive). However, since we only know that \\( T \\) *might not* be true, we cannot conclude ¬\\( C \\) with certainty. The information given is too weak to support that inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
