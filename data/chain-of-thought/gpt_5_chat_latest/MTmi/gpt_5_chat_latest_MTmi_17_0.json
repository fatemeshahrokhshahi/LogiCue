But the second statement says it’s possible that Kate did not eat salad (¬K).  \n\nIf ¬K is possible, then B cannot be true, because if B were true, K would have to be true. Therefore, the only way for ¬K to be possible is if B is false.  \n\nThus, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
