            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis,\" can be written logically as:  \nIf J (Jeff played basketball), then A (Amy played tennis). Symbolically, J → A.  \n\nThe second statement, \"Amy might not have played tennis,\" means that it is possible that Amy did not play tennis — in other words, ¬A is possible.  \n\nFrom J → A, the contrapositive is ¬A → ¬J. This means that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.  \n\nHowever, the second statement does not assert that Amy did not play tennis; it only says that she *might not have*. That is, we do not know for sure whether ¬A is true — only that it’s possible.  \n\nSince we do not have definite information that ¬A is true, we cannot definitively conclude ¬J (that Jeff did not play basketball). We can only say that it’s possible Jeff did not play basketball, not that it must be the case.  \n\nAnswer: no",
