This expresses uncertainty about C, not a definite claim that C is false.  \n\nTo infer \"Alex did not finish the race\" (¬A) from these statements, we would need to know that Chris definitely did *not* finish (¬C). Only then could we use the contrapositive of the first statement (\"If not C, then not A\") to conclude that Alex did not finish.  \n\nHowever, since the second statement only says that Chris *might not* have finished — not that he definitely didn’t — we cannot logically conclude that Alex did not finish. The information is insufficient to make that inference.  \n\nAnswer: no",
