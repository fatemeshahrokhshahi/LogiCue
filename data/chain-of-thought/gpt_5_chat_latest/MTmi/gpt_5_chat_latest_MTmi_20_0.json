            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow,\" can be represented logically as:  \nIf A (apple was red), then B (banana was yellow).  \n\nThe second statement, \"The banana might not have been yellow,\" means that it is possible that the banana was not yellow — in other words, we cannot be certain that B is true. This expresses uncertainty about B, not a definite claim that B is false.  \n\nTo infer \"The apple was not red\" (¬A) from the given information, we would need to know that B is definitely false (that the banana was not yellow). Only then, by modus tollens, could we conclude ¬A. However, since we only know that B *might not* be true, we cannot conclude ¬A with certainty.  \n\nTherefore, the inference \"The apple was not red\" does not logically follow from the given statements.  \n\nAnswer: no",
