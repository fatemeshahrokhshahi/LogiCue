            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\"  \n   Symbolically, this can be written as:  \n   **B → W** (If B, then W).  \n2. \"The wolf might not have been in the den.\"  \n   This means it is *possible* that the wolf was not in the den — in other words, we do **not** know for sure that W is true; W could be false.\n\nTo infer \"The bear was not in the cave\" (¬B), we would need to know that the wolf was *definitely not* in the den (¬W).  \nFrom B → W, if we knew ¬W, then we could conclude ¬B by modus tollens.  \nHowever, the second statement only says that the wolf *might not* have been in the den — it does not assert ¬W as a fact.  \nSince we only have uncertainty about W, we cannot logically conclude ¬B.  \n\nTherefore, the inference \"The bear was not in the cave\" does **not** follow.  \n\nAnswer: no",
