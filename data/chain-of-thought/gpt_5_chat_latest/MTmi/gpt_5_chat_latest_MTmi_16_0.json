            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim,\" can be represented logically as:  \nIf \\( C \\) (shirt is cotton), then \\( D \\) (pants are denim).  \nSymbolically: \\( C \\rightarrow D \\).\n\nThe second statement, \"The pants might not have been denim,\" means that it is possible that \\( D \\) is false — in other words, we do not know for sure that \\( D \\) is true. This expresses uncertainty about \\( D \\), not a definite claim that \\( D \\) is false.\n\nTo infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" (¬\\( C \\)), we would need to know that \\( D \\) is definitely false, because only then could we apply the contrapositive of the first statement (\\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)). However, since we only know that \\( D \\) *might not* be true, we cannot conclude that \\( D \\) is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
