            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" can be represented logically as:  \nIf \\( J \\) (Joe went to the park), then \\( L \\) (Lucy went to the zoo).  \nSymbolically: \\( J \\rightarrow L \\).\n\nThe second statement, \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo,\" means that it is possible that \\( L \\) is false — in other words, we do not know for sure that \\( L \\) is true. This expresses uncertainty about \\( L \\), not a definite claim that \\( L \\) is false.\n\nTo infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" (¬\\( J \\)), we would need to know that \\( L \\) is definitely false, because the contrapositive of the first statement is:  \nIf Lucy did not go to the zoo (¬\\( L \\)), then Joe did not go to the park (¬\\( J \\)).  \n\nHowever, since we only know that Lucy *might not* have gone to the zoo (i.e., it’s possible she didn’t, but also possible she did), we cannot conclude with certainty that Joe did not go to the park. The information given is insufficient to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
