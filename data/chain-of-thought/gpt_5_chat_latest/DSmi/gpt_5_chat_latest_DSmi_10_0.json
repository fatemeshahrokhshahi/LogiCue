            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed,\" can be represented logically as:  \n\\( L \\lor B \\)  \n(where \\( L \\) = \"the sock is in the laundry basket\" and \\( B \\) = \"the sock is under the bed\").  \n\nThe second statement, \"The missing sock might not be under the bed,\" means it is *possible* that the sock is not under the bed — but it does not assert that it is *definitely* not under the bed. In logical terms, this expresses uncertainty about \\( B \\); it does not give us ¬\\( B \\) as a definite fact.  \n\nTo infer \\( L \\) (that the sock is in the laundry basket) from \\( L \\lor B \\), we would need to know that \\( B \\) is false (¬\\( B \\)). However, since we only know that \\( B \\) *might not* be true, we cannot conclude \\( L \\) with certainty.  \n\nTherefore, the inference is not valid.  \n\nAnswer: no",
