            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head,\" can be represented logically as:  \n\\( B \\lor H \\) — meaning either they are in her bag (B) or on her head (H).  \n\nThe second statement, \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head,\" does **not** assert that they are *not* on her head; it only says that it’s *possible* they are not. In logical terms, this expresses uncertainty about \\( H \\), not a definite negation (\\( \\neg H \\)).  \n\nTo infer that the sunglasses are in her bag (\\( B \\)), we would need to know that they are *not* on her head (\\( \\neg H \\)). But since we only know that it’s *possible* they are not on her head, we cannot conclude \\( B \\) with certainty.  \n\nTherefore, the inference is not valid.  \n\nAnswer: no",
