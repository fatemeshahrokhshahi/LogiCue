            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"  \n   This can be represented logically as: \\( I \\lor G \\) (where \\( I \\) = \"Fido is inside\", \\( G \\) = \"Fido must be in the garden\").  \n2. \"Fido might not be in the garden.\"  \n   This means it is *possible* that Fido is not in the garden — but it does not assert that he is *definitely* not in the garden. It only denies certainty about \\( G \\); it does not affirm \\( \\neg G \\).\n\nTo infer \"Fido is inside\" (\\( I \\)), we would need to know that \\( G \\) is false (i.e., Fido is *not* in the garden). However, the second statement only says that it is *possible* that Fido is not in the garden, not that he actually isn’t. Therefore, we cannot conclude \\( I \\) with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
