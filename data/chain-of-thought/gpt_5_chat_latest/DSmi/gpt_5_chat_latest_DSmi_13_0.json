            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf,\" can be represented logically as:  \n\\( T \\lor B \\) — where \\( T \\) = \"the toy is in the toy box\" and \\( B \\) = \"the toy is on the bookshelf.\"  \n\nThe second statement, \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf,\" does **not** assert that the toy is *not* on the bookshelf; it only expresses uncertainty or possibility that it is not there. In logical terms, \"might not\" does not entail \"not.\"  \n\nTo validly infer \\( T \\) (that the toy is in the toy box) from \\( T \\lor B \\), we would need to know that \\( B \\) is false. But since we only know that \\( B \\) *might* be false, we cannot conclude \\( T \\) with certainty.  \n\nTherefore, the inference is not valid.  \n\nAnswer: no",
