            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe original statement, \"If I finish my homework, I can play video games,\" sets up a conditional relationship where finishing homework is sufficient for being allowed to play video games. It does not mention or depend on any other conditions.  \n\nThe new statement adds an extra condition: \"and my computer catches on fire.\" This changes the situation significantly. The original conditional does not guarantee that the conclusion (\"I can play video games\") still holds when additional conditions are added. In fact, if the computer catches on fire, it would likely prevent playing video games, even if the homework is finished.  \n\nIn logic, from \"If P then Q,\" we cannot infer \"If P and R then Q\" unless we know that R does not affect the outcome. Since that is not given here, the inference is invalid.  \n\nAnswer: no",
