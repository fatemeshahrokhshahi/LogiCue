In the case of (P ∧ O), P is still true (since P ∧ O implies P). Therefore, S must also be true. This means that (P ∧ O) → S is indeed logically entailed by P → S.  \n\nSo, even though the added condition \"the item is out of stock\" might make the statement sound odd in real-world terms, in pure logic, the inference is valid.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
