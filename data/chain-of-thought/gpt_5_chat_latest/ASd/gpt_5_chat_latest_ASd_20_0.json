            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe original statement, \"If I take medication, I will feel better,\" establishes a conditional relationship between taking medication (in general) and feeling better. However, it does not specify *what kind* of medication or under what conditions it is taken. The phrase \"medication that expired\" introduces a new qualifier that changes the meaning of the antecedent. Expired medication may not have the same effect as regular medication—it could be less effective or even harmful. Therefore, the inference from the original statement to the new one is not logically valid, because the original statement does not guarantee that *all* forms of medication, including expired ones, will produce the same result.  \n\nAnswer: no",
