            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe original statement is a conditional: \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\" Symbolically, this can be represented as:  \nP → Q,  \nwhere P = \"the essay is well-written\" and Q = \"the student will get an A.\"\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\" Symbolically, that would be:  \n(P ∧ R) → Q,  \nwhere R = \"the essay is turned in late.\"\n\nFrom logic, we know that P → Q does **not** imply (P ∧ R) → Q. The reason is that adding an extra condition (R) to the antecedent can change the situation — the rule only guarantees an A when the essay is well-written, but it says nothing about what happens if it’s also turned in late. The lateness could affect the grade, so we cannot logically infer the new conditional from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
