The statement (C ∧ D) → P has a stronger condition (C ∧ D) than C alone. However, if C → P is true, then any situation where C is true (including when D is also true) must make P true. Therefore, (C ∧ D) → P is also true whenever C → P is true.  \n\nSo, yes, the inference is logically valid — adding an extra condition (D) to the antecedent does not invalidate the implication.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
