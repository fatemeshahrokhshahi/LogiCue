            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe original statement is a conditional: “If the dog is in the yard, then it is barking.” Symbolically, this can be written as:  \nP → Q,  \nwhere P = “the dog is in the yard” and Q = “the dog is barking.”  \n\nThe proposed inference is: “If the dog is in the yard and it is asleep, then it is barking.” Symbolically, that is:  \n(P ∧ R) → Q,  \nwhere R = “the dog is asleep.”  \n\nTo check if this inference is valid, we ask: does P → Q logically entail (P ∧ R) → Q?  \nIf P → Q is true, then whenever P is true, Q must be true. If both P and R are true, then P is still true, so Q must still be true. Therefore, (P ∧ R) → Q is also true whenever P → Q is true.  \n\nThus, the inference is logically valid.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
