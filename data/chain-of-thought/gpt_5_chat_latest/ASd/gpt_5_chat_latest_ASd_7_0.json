            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe original statement is a conditional: \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\" Symbolically, this can be written as:  \nO → W  \n(where O = \"the oven is on\" and W = \"the kitchen is warm\").  \n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm,\" which can be written as:  \n(O ∧ P) → W  \n(where P = \"the pilot light is out\").  \n\nTo check if this inference is valid, we ask: does O → W logically entail (O ∧ P) → W?  \n\nIf O → W is true, then whenever O is true, W must be true. The new antecedent (O ∧ P) implies O is true (since both O and P must be true). Therefore, whenever (O ∧ P) is true, O is true, and thus W must also be true.  \n\nSo, yes, the inference is logically valid — adding an extra condition to the antecedent does not break the implication, because the truth of O already guarantees W.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
