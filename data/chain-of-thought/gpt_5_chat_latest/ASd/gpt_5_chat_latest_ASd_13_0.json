            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe original statement, \"If I exercise, I will lose weight,\" means that exercising is a sufficient condition for losing weight. However, when we add \"and eat junk food\" to the condition, we are changing the situation. The new statement, \"If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight,\" introduces an additional factor—eating junk food—that could affect the outcome. The original statement does not tell us what happens when both exercising and eating junk food occur together. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original one, because the added condition might change the result.  \n\nAnswer: no",
