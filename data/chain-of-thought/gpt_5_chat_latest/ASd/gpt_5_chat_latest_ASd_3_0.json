If \\( P \\land R \\) is true, then \\( P \\) is also true (since \\( P \\land R \\) implies \\( P \\)). Therefore, \\( Q \\) must also be true.  \n\nThus, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) logically entails \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\). The additional condition \\( R \\) (the garage flooding) does not affect the truth of the implication.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
