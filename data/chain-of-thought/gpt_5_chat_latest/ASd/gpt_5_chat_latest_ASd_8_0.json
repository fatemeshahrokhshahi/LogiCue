            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe original statement is a conditional:  \n- If the package has shipped (P), then it will arrive today (Q).  \nSymbolically: P → Q.  \n\nThe proposed inference is:  \n- If the package has shipped and it was misrouted (P ∧ R), then it will arrive today (Q).  \nSymbolically: (P ∧ R) → Q.  \n\nTo check if this inference is valid, we ask: does P → Q logically entail (P ∧ R) → Q?  \n\nIf P → Q is true, that means whenever P is true, Q must be true.  \nNow, if P ∧ R is true, then P is certainly true (since P ∧ R implies P).  \nBecause P is true, Q must also be true (by the original conditional).  \nTherefore, whenever P ∧ R is true, Q must be true.  \n\nThis shows that (P ∧ R) → Q logically follows from P → Q.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
