            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe original statement says, \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\" This means that getting enough sleep is sufficient to prevent tiredness, assuming no other factors interfere. However, the new statement adds an extra condition: \"and do hard labor.\" Doing hard labor could independently cause tiredness, even if one gets enough sleep. The original statement does not mention or account for this additional factor, so we cannot logically infer that the conclusion (\"you won't be tired\") still holds when a new condition (doing hard labor) is added. The inference would only be valid if the original statement explicitly said that *no matter what else you do*, getting enough sleep guarantees you won’t be tired—but it doesn’t.  \n\nAnswer: no",
