The additional condition B (the check bounces) does not affect the truth of S, because the original conditional guarantees S whenever P is true, regardless of any other conditions. Therefore, (P → S) does indeed entail (P ∧ B → S).  \n\nIn other words, if paying the bill is sufficient for the services to continue, then even if something else (like the check bouncing) also happens, as long as the bill is paid, the services will continue according to the given statement.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
