It’s not the case that the pen must be on my desk.  \n\nLet’s symbolize:  \n- \\( P \\): The pen is in my bag.  \n- \\( Q \\): The pen must be on my desk.  \n\nThe first statement translates to \\( P \\lor Q \\).  \nThe second statement translates to \\( \\neg Q \\).  \n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer \\( P \\) by disjunctive syllogism.  \n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can validly infer that the pen is in my bag.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
