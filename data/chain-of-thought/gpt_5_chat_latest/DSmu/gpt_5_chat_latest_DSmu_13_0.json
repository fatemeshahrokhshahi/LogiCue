It’s not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.  \n\nLet’s symbolize:  \n- \\( T \\): The toy is in the toy box.  \n- \\( B \\): The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.  \n\nThen the premises are:  \n1. \\( T \\lor B \\)  \n2. \\( \\neg B \\)  \n\nFrom these, by disjunctive syllogism (if \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), then \\( A \\)), we can infer \\( T \\).  \n\nTherefore, the conclusion “The toy is in the toy box” logically follows from the premises.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
