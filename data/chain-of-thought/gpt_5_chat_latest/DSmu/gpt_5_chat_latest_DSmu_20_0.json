            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.  \n2. It’s not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.  \n\nLet’s symbolize:  \n- \\( B \\): The sunglasses are in her bag.  \n- \\( H \\): The sunglasses must be perched on her head.  \n\nThe first statement says \\( B \\lor H \\) (either \\( B \\) or \\( H \\)).  \nThe second statement says \\( \\neg H \\) (not \\( H \\)).  \n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have \\( B \\lor H \\) and \\( \\neg H \\), we can infer \\( B \\) by disjunctive syllogism (if one disjunct is false, the other must be true).  \n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can validly infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
