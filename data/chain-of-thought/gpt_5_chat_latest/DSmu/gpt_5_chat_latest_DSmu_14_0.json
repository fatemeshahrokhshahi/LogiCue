            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.  \n   Symbolically, this can be represented as \\( P \\lor Q \\), where  \n   \\( P \\): The milk is on the counter,  \n   \\( Q \\): The milk must be chilling in the fridge.  \n\n2. It’s not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.  \n   Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg Q \\).  \n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\)) and we also know \\( \\neg Q \\) (not \\( Q \\)), then by disjunctive syllogism we can infer \\( P \\).  \n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can validly infer that the milk is on the counter.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
