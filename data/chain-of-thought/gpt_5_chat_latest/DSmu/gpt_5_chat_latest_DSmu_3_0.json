It’s not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.  \n\nLet’s symbolize:  \n- \\( D \\): The keys are in the drawer.  \n- \\( C \\): The keys must be dangling in the cabinet.  \n\nThe first statement translates to \\( D \\lor C \\).  \nThe second statement translates to \\( \\neg C \\).  \n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have \\( D \\lor C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\), we can apply disjunctive syllogism:  \nSince one disjunct (\\( C \\)) is false, the other (\\( D \\)) must be true.  \n\nTherefore, we can validly infer that the keys are in the drawer.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
