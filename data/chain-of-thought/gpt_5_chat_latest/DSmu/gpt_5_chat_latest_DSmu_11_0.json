It’s not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.  \n\nLet’s symbolize:  \n- \\( D \\): The newspaper is in the driveway.  \n- \\( P \\): The newspaper must be sitting on the porch.  \n\nThe first statement translates to \\( D \\lor P \\).  \nThe second statement translates to \\( \\neg P \\).  \n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have \\( D \\lor P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we can apply disjunctive syllogism:  \nSince one disjunct (\\( P \\)) is false, the other (\\( D \\)) must be true.  \n\nTherefore, we can validly infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
