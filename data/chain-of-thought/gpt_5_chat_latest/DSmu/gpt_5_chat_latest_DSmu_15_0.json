It’s not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.  \n\nLet’s symbolize:  \n- \\( C \\): The shoes are in the closet.  \n- \\( D \\): The shoes must be lined up by the door.  \n\nThe first statement translates to \\( C \\lor D \\) (either \\( C \\) or \\( D \\)).  \nThe second statement translates to \\( \\neg D \\) (not \\( D \\)).  \n\nFrom \\( C \\lor D \\) and \\( \\neg D \\), by disjunctive syllogism, we can infer \\( C \\).  \n\nTherefore, logically, the conclusion “The shoes are in the closet” follows validly from the premises.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
