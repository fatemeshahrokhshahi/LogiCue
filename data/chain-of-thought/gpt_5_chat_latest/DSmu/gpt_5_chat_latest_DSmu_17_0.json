            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.  \n   Symbolically: \\( P \\lor Q \\)  \n   (where \\( P \\): \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\", \\( Q \\): \"The scarf must be draped on the coat rack\")  \n\n2. It’s not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.  \n   Symbolically: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can apply disjunctive syllogism, which allows us to infer \\( P \\).  \n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can validly infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
