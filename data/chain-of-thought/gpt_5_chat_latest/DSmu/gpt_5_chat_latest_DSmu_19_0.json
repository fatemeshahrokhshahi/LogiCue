            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.  \n   Symbolically: \\( C \\lor W \\)  \n   (where \\( C \\) = \"the watch is charging on the dresser\" and \\( W \\) = \"the watch must be on his wrist\")  \n2. It’s not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.  \n   Symbolically: \\( \\neg W \\)\n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have a disjunction \\( C \\lor W \\) and we know that one of the disjuncts (\\( W \\)) is false (\\( \\neg W \\)), then the other disjunct (\\( C \\)) must be true. This is an application of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, from \\( C \\lor W \\) and \\( \\neg W \\), we can validly infer \\( C \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
