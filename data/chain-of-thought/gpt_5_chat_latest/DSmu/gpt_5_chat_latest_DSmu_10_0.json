            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.  \n   Symbolically: \\( L \\lor B \\)  \n   (where \\( L \\) = \"the missing sock is in the laundry basket\" and \\( B \\) = \"it must be under the bed\")  \n2. It’s not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.  \n   Symbolically: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have a disjunction \\( L \\lor B \\) and we know that one of the disjuncts (\\( B \\)) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), then the other disjunct (\\( L \\)) must be true. This is the rule of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, from \\( L \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can validly infer \\( L \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
