            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.  \n   Symbolically: \\( P \\lor Q \\)  \n   (where \\( P \\): \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\", and \\( Q \\): \"It must be blending in on the floor\")  \n\n2. It’s not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.  \n   Symbolically: \\( \\neg Q \\)  \n\nFrom propositional logic, the disjunction \\( P \\lor Q \\) together with the negation of one disjunct \\( \\neg Q \\) allows us to infer the other disjunct \\( P \\). This is the rule of disjunctive syllogism.  \n\nTherefore, from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can validly infer \\( P \\): \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"  \n\nAnswer: yes",
