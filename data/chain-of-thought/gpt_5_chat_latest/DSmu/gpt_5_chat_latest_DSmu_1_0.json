It’s not the case that Fido must be in the garden.  \n\nLet’s symbolize them for clarity:  \n- \\( P \\): Fido is inside.  \n- \\( Q \\): Fido must be in the garden.  \n\nThen the premises are:  \n1. \\( P \\lor Q \\)  \n2. \\( \\neg Q \\)  \n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have a disjunction \\( P \\lor Q \\) and we know that one of the disjuncts (\\( Q \\)) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), we can validly infer that the other disjunct (\\( P \\)) must be true.  \n\nTherefore, from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer \\( P \\).  \n\nAnswer: yes",
