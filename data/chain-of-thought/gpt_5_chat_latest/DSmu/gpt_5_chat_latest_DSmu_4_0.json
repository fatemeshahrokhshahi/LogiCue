            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.  \n2. It’s not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.  \n\nLet’s symbolize them for clarity:  \n- \\( N \\): The cat is napping on the couch.  \n- \\( P \\): The cat must be playing in the bedroom.  \n\nThen the premises are:  \n1. \\( N \\lor P \\)  \n2. \\( \\neg P \\)  \n\nFrom these, by the rule of disjunctive syllogism (if \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), then \\( A \\)), we can validly infer \\( N \\).  \n\nTherefore, the conclusion “The cat is napping on the couch” logically follows from the premises.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
