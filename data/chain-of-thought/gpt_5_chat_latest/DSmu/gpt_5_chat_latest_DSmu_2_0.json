It’s not the case that the book must be resting on the table.  \n\nLet’s symbolize:  \n- \\( S \\): The book is on the shelf.  \n- \\( T \\): The book must be resting on the table.  \n\nThe first statement translates to \\( S \\lor T \\).  \nThe second statement translates to \\( \\neg T \\).  \n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have \\( S \\lor T \\) and \\( \\neg T \\), we can apply disjunctive syllogism:  \nSince one disjunct (\\( T \\)) is false, the other (\\( S \\)) must be true.  \n\nTherefore, we can validly infer that the book is on the shelf.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
