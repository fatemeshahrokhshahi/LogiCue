It’s not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.  \n\nLet’s symbolize:  \n- \\( D \\): The notebook is in the drawer.  \n- \\( N \\): The notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.  \n\nThe first statement translates to \\( D \\lor N \\).  \nThe second statement translates to \\( \\neg N \\).  \n\nFrom propositional logic, if we have \\( D \\lor N \\) and \\( \\neg N \\), we can apply disjunctive syllogism:  \n- Since one disjunct (\\( N \\)) is false, the other (\\( D \\)) must be true.  \n\nTherefore, we can validly infer that the notebook is in the drawer.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
