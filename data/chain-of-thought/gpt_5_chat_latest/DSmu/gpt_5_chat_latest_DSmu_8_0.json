            "content": "Explanation:  \nThe first statement, \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch,\" can be represented logically as \\( P \\lor Q \\), where \\( P \\) = \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" and \\( Q \\) = \"The remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"  \n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" is the negation of \\( Q \\), i.e., \\( \\neg Q \\).  \n\nFrom the disjunction \\( P \\lor Q \\) and the negation \\( \\neg Q \\), we can apply the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which allows us to infer \\( P \\).  \n\nTherefore, from these two premises, we can validly infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"  \n\nAnswer: yes",
