            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are given two statements:  \n1. Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.  \n   Symbolically, this can be represented as \\( P \\lor Q \\), where  \n   \\( P \\): The jacket is draped over the chair,  \n   \\( Q \\): The jacket must be hanging in the closet.  \n\n2. It’s not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.  \n   Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg Q \\).  \n\nFrom propositional logic, the disjunction \\( P \\lor Q \\) combined with the negation of one disjunct \\( \\neg Q \\) allows us to infer the other disjunct \\( P \\). This is a valid inference rule known as *disjunctive syllogism*.  \n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can validly infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
