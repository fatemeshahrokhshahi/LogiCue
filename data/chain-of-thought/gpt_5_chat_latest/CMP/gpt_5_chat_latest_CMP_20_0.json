    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are told that coffee, tea, and soda are the only major morning drinks. The statement “if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers” can be symbolized as:  \n¬T → (¬C → S).  \n\nWe are also told that coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers (so C is likely true), and hence tea likely won’t (so ¬T is likely true).  \n\nGiven ¬T → (¬C → S), if ¬T is true (or likely true), then the conditional (¬C → S) follows. That means: if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will.  \n\nSince ¬T is likely true, it’s likely that the conditional (¬C → S) holds. Therefore, it *does* follow that it’s likely that if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
