    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny’s album doesn’t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift’s doesn’t, Beyonce’s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift’s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are told that there are three albums: Taylor Swift (T), Bad Bunny (B), and Beyoncé (Y). The experts project that T will likely sell the most, followed by B, with Y far behind. The logical condition given is:  \n> If B doesn’t sell the most, then if T doesn’t, Y will.  \n\nSymbolically:  \n¬B → (¬T → Y).  \n\nWe are also told that T likely will sell the most, and hence B likely won’t. So it’s likely that ¬B is true.  \n\nNow, the question asks whether it follows that it’s likely that *if T doesn’t sell the most, Y will*.  \n\nGiven that it’s likely ¬B, and the conditional ¬B → (¬T → Y) holds, we can infer that it’s likely that (¬T → Y) also holds, because if ¬B is likely true, then the inner conditional (¬T → Y) is likely true as well.  \n\nThus, yes—it follows that it’s likely that if Taylor Swift’s album doesn’t sell the most, Beyoncé’s will.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
