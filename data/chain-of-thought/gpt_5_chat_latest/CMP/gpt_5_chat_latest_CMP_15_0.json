    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nLet’s restate the information logically.  \n\nWe have three markets:  \n- S = stocks  \n- R = real estate  \n- B = bonds  \n\nWe’re told:  \n1. Stocks likely will have the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds significantly lower.  \n2. “If real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will.”  \n   Symbolically: ¬R → (¬S → B).  \n3. “Stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t.”  \n   So it’s likely that S is true and ¬R is true.  \n\nWe’re asked: Does it follow that it’s *likely* that if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?  \nThat is, is it likely that (¬S → B)?  \n\nFrom (2), we know that if ¬R holds, then (¬S → B) holds.  \nSince it’s *likely* that ¬R (because stocks likely have the highest returns, not real estate), it’s *likely* that the condition ¬R is true.  \nIf ¬R is likely true, then the implication ¬R → (¬S → B) makes it likely that (¬S → B) holds.  \n\nTherefore, given the premises, it *does* follow that it’s likely that if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
