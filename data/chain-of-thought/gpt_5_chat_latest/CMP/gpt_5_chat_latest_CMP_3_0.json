    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn’t win, then if Spain doesn’t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won’t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn’t win, England will?",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are told that Spain, Brazil, and England are the only realistic contenders. The conditional statement “if Brazil doesn’t win, then if Spain doesn’t win, England will win” means that whenever Brazil fails to win, the winner must be either Spain or, if Spain also fails, England.  \n\nWe also know it is *likely* that Spain will win, and therefore *unlikely* that Brazil will win. However, the question asks whether it follows that it is *likely that, if Spain doesn’t win, England will win*.  \n\nTo assess this, note that the likelihood of the conditional “if Spain doesn’t win, England will win” depends on what happens in the cases where Spain doesn’t win. In those cases, the only remaining possibilities are Brazil or England. But since Brazil is the second most likely team overall, it is still quite possible (and even more likely than England) that Brazil would win if Spain doesn’t. Thus, even though Spain is likely to win overall, it does *not* follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn’t win, England will win. The likelihood of that conditional depends on the relative probabilities of Brazil and England *given that Spain doesn’t win*, and Brazil is still more likely in that scenario.  \n\nAnswer: no",
