    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are told that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the only major transportation providers. The data suggest Uber will likely have the most rides, Lyft second, and taxis significantly fewer. The statement “if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides” expresses a conditional relationship:  \n- If Lyft is not the top provider, then in the hypothetical case that Uber also isn’t the top provider, taxis would be the top provider.  \n\nWe are also told that Uber likely will give the most rides, and therefore Lyft likely won’t. Given that Lyft likely won’t give the most rides, the antecedent of the conditional (“Lyft doesn’t give the most rides”) is likely true. If that antecedent is true, then the conditional tells us that in the hypothetical situation where Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis would.  \n\nSo, even though Uber is likely to give the most rides, the conditional relationship implies that *if* Uber doesn’t, taxis would. Since the conditional is given as true and Lyft likely won’t give the most rides, it follows that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
