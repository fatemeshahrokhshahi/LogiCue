    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are told that Priya is most likely to get the offer, Julian is next most likely, and Diego is least likely. The statement “if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will” means that among the three, if Priya doesn’t get it, then Diego must (since Julian not getting it implies that the only remaining candidate is Diego).  \n\nHowever, the question asks whether it *follows* that it is *likely* that if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will. The key distinction is between what is *logically implied* and what is *probable*.  \n\nWe know it’s *likely* that Priya will get the offer, which means the probability that she doesn’t is small. But that doesn’t make it *likely* that, in the case she doesn’t, Diego will get it. In fact, given the ranking, if Priya doesn’t get it, it’s still more probable that Julian would get it than Diego. So even though Diego would get it *if both Priya and Julian don’t*, that scenario is less likely than Julian getting it if Priya doesn’t.  \n\nTherefore, it does **not** follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will.  \n\nAnswer: no",
