    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will?",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are told that there are three illnesses—flu, cold, and strep—and that one of them will infect the most people. The doctors expect the flu to infect the most, followed by the cold, with strep lagging behind.  \n\nWe also have a conditional statement:  \n- If colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will.  \n\nSymbolically, let:  \n- F = flu infects the most  \n- C = cold infects the most  \n- S = strep infects the most  \n\nThe conditional can be written as:  \n¬C → (¬F → S).  \n\nWe are also told that flu likely will infect the most, and hence colds likely won’t. So it’s likely that ¬C is true.  \n\nGiven ¬C, the conditional simplifies to (¬F → S). That means: if flu doesn’t infect the most, then strep will.  \n\nSince it’s likely that ¬C is true, it’s likely that the conditional (¬F → S) holds. Therefore, it *does* follow that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
