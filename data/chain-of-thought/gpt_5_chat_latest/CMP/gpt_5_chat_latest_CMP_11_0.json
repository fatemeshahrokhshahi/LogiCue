    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn’t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn’t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn’t lead in sales, Honda will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are told that Ford, Toyota, and Honda are the top three brands. The analysis expects Ford to sell the most, Toyota to be close behind, and Honda to lag significantly. The statement “if Toyota isn’t #1, then if Ford isn’t, Honda will be” expresses a conditional relationship: if Toyota fails to lead, then in the event Ford also fails, Honda would lead.  \n\nHowever, we also know that Ford is likely to lead, and therefore Toyota likely won’t. The question asks whether it *follows* that it is *likely* that, if Ford doesn’t lead, Honda will.  \n\nTo assess this, note that the likelihood of Ford leading is high, so the scenario “Ford doesn’t lead” is unlikely. The conditional “if Ford doesn’t lead, Honda will” depends on what would happen in that unlikely case. The given information only says that *if Toyota isn’t #1*, then *if Ford isn’t, Honda will be*. But since Toyota likely isn’t #1 (because Ford likely is), that conditional applies. Still, the likelihood of the conditional being true (“if Ford doesn’t lead, Honda will”) is not necessarily high just because Ford is likely to lead. The conditional could be true as a logical statement, but the *likelihood* that it holds (in a probabilistic sense) is not increased by Ford’s high chance of leading.  \n\nThus, it does not *follow* that it is *likely* that, if Ford doesn’t lead, Honda will—because the likelihood of that conditional being true is not supported by the given information; we only know Ford is likely to lead, not that Honda would be next if Ford doesn’t.  \n\nAnswer: no",
