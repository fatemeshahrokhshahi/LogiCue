    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nLet’s restate the information logically.  \n\nWe have three variables:  \n- R = rents increase the most  \n- H = home prices increase the most  \n- M = mortgage rates increase the most  \n\nWe’re told:  \n1. Economists project: R likely > H > M (in terms of increase).  \n2. A conditional statement:  \n   - If home prices don’t increase the most (¬H), then if rents don’t increase the most (¬R), mortgage rates will increase the most (M).  \n   Symbolically: ¬H → (¬R → M).  \n3. It’s also said that rents likely will increase the most (R likely true), and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most (¬H likely true).  \n\nWe’re asked: Does it follow that it’s *likely* that if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?  \nThat is, does it follow that (¬R → M) is likely?  \n\nFrom (2), we know that if ¬H is true, then (¬R → M) must hold.  \nFrom (3), we know ¬H is likely true.  \nIf ¬H is likely true, then the conditional (¬R → M) is likely true as well, because the truth of ¬H makes the implication (¬H → (¬R → M)) likely to apply.  \n\nTherefore, given the premises, it *does* follow that it’s likely that if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
