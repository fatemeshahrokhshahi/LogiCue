    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it’s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be. Moreover, it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are told that it’s *likely* apples will be the top-selling fruit, followed by bananas, with oranges far behind. The statement “if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be” expresses a conditional relationship among the rankings. However, the key question is about *likelihood*: does it follow that it is *likely* that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?\n\nFrom the information given, apples are most likely to be top, bananas are next most likely, and oranges are least likely. The conditional “if apples aren’t top, oranges will be” is not likely, because if apples fail to be top, the next most probable top fruit is bananas, not oranges. The statement that “if bananas aren’t top, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be” doesn’t make it likely that oranges would be top if apples aren’t—it just describes a logical dependency, not a probability claim. Therefore, it does *not* follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t top, oranges will be.\n\nAnswer: no",
