    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are told that only one of three possible new laws will pass: a minimum wage hike (W), paid family leave (L), or student loan forgiveness (F). The probabilities are such that W is most likely, L is next, and F is least likely. The statement “if paid leave doesn’t happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn’t happen, loan forgiveness will happen” means that in the scenario where L does not occur, the only remaining possibilities are W or F, and if W also doesn’t occur, then F must occur.  \n\nWe are also told that a minimum wage hike likely will happen, and hence paid leave likely won’t happen. So the most probable world is one where W happens and L and F do not.  \n\nThe question asks whether it follows that it’s *likely* that, if a minimum wage hike doesn’t happen, loan forgiveness will. This is a conditional probability question: we’re asked about the likelihood of the conditional statement “if not W, then F.” Given the setup, the only alternative to W is F (since only one law can pass and L is unlikely). So, in the worlds where W doesn’t happen, F would indeed happen (because L is ruled out or very unlikely).  \n\nHowever, the phrase “it’s likely that, if W doesn’t happen, F will” refers to the likelihood of that conditional being true, not the likelihood of F itself. Since the structure of the situation ensures that if W doesn’t happen, F must (because only one law can pass and L is ruled out), the conditional itself is very likely true.  \n\nTherefore, yes—it follows that it’s likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn’t happen, loan forgiveness will.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
