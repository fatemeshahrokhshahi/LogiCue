    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are told that Tennessee (T), Georgia (G), and Missouri (M) are the top three states for job growth. The relationships are as follows:  \n\n1. **Conditional statement:** If Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will.  \n   Symbolically: ¬G → (¬T → M).  \n\n2. **Likely facts:** Tennessee likely will add the most jobs (so T is likely true), and hence Georgia likely won’t (so G is likely false).  \n\nGiven that G is likely false, the conditional ¬G → (¬T → M) becomes relevant. If ¬G is true, then the statement says that if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will.  \n\nNow, since it’s *likely* that Tennessee *will* add the most jobs, the antecedent ¬T is unlikely. But the question asks whether it *follows that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will.*  \n\nThe key is that the conditional relationship (¬T → M) is embedded in the given information: it’s guaranteed under the assumption that Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs (which is likely). So even though Tennessee’s leading is likely, the conditional “if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will” is still likely true, because the structure of the given statements makes that conditional hold whenever Georgia doesn’t lead — and Georgia likely doesn’t.  \n\nTherefore, it *does* follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will.  \n\nAnswer: yes",
