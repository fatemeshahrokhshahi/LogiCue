    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

            "content": "Explanation:  \nWe are told that India, China, and Russia are the three biggest emerging economies. Economists project that India’s economy will likely grow the fastest, followed by China, with Russia lagging far behind. The statement “if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be” expresses a conditional relationship among the three.  \n\nLet’s unpack the logic:  \n1. The projection says India will likely grow the fastest, so it’s likely that India *is* the top-growing economy.  \n2. It also says that China’s growth will be second and Russia’s will be far behind.  \n3. The conditional “if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be” is given as true.  \n4. Since it’s likely that India *is* the top-growing economy, the antecedent “if India isn’t the top-growing economy” is unlikely.  \n5. The question asks whether it *follows* that it’s likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be.  \n\nHowever, the projection that Russia’s growth rate lags “distantly behind” makes it *unlikely* that Russia would be the top-growing economy even if India weren’t. In that case, China would almost certainly take the top spot. Therefore, it does *not* follow that it’s likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be.  \n\nAnswer: no",
