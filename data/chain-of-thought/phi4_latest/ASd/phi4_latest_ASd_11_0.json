The original statement is \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\" This implies that sufficient sleep alone is a condition for not being tired.\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\"\n\n3. Doing hard labor typically leads to physical exhaustion, which generally causes tiredness regardless of how much sleep one gets.\n\n4. The original statement does not account for additional factors like hard labor that could independently cause tiredness.\n\n5. Therefore, even if someone gets enough sleep, doing hard labor might still result in them being tired due to the physical exertion involved.\n\n6. Since the original statement only guarantees no tiredness with sufficient sleep and does not consider other factors like hard labor, we cannot logically infer that getting enough sleep will prevent tiredness when combined with hard labor.\n\nAnswer: no",
