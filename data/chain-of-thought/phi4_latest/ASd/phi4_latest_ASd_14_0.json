The original statement \"If I study hard, I will pass the test\" can be represented as:\n   - P: I study hard\n   - Q: I will pass the test\n\n   This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q (P → Q).\n\n2. We want to infer whether adding an additional condition (\"the test is in Chinese\") affects this implication.\n\n3. The new statement \"If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test\" can be represented as:\n   - R: The test is in Chinese\n\n   This becomes a compound conditional statement: If (P ∧ R), then Q ((P ∧ R) → Q).\n\n4. To determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider whether adding \"the test is in Chinese\" changes the truth of the original implication.\n\n5. The original statement does not specify any conditions about the language of the test. It only states that studying hard leads to passing the test without additional qualifiers.\n\n6. Adding a condition (R) creates a more specific scenario, but it doesn't inherently change the outcome unless there is information suggesting that the language of the test affects the ability to pass when studying hard.\n\n7. Without any explicit information indicating that the language of the test impacts the result, we cannot assume that adding \"the test is in Chinese\" changes the validity of passing the test if one studies hard.\n\n8. Therefore, based on the given information alone, the inference holds because there's no evidence to suggest that studying hard would not lead to passing a test specifically in Chinese.\n\nAnswer: yes",
