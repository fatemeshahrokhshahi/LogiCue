In other words, for the implication to hold, whenever \\( A \\) is true, \\( R \\) cannot be false.\n  \n- The second statement tells us that it's possible \\( R \\) is false (\\( \\neg R \\)). If \\( \\neg R \\) is indeed true (i.e., the robot did not visit Jupiter), then for the implication \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) to hold, \\( A \\) must be false. This is because if \\( A \\) were true and \\( R \\) were false, it would violate the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, given that \\( \\neg R \\) is a possibility (the robot might not have visited Jupiter), for the implication \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) to remain valid, \\( A \\) must be false. Thus, we can infer \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
