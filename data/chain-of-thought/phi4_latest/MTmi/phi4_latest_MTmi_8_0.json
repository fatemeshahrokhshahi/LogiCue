            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. \"The mummy might not have been awake.\" This suggests that it's possible for the mummy to not be awake, which we can represent as \\( \\neg M \\) being a possibility.\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer \"The vampire was not awake\" (\\( \\neg V \\)).\n\n- From the first statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), we know that if \\( V \\) is true (the vampire is awake), then \\( M \\) must also be true (the mummy is awake). The contrapositive of this implication, which is logically equivalent, is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\). This means if the mummy was not awake (\\( \\neg M \\)), then the vampire could not have been awake (\\( \\neg V \\)).\n\n- Given \"The mummy might not have been awake\" (\\( \\neg M \\) is possible), we can use the contrapositive \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\). If it's possible that \\( \\neg M \\) is true, then it must also be possible that \\( \\neg V \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical implications of the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The vampire was not awake\" (\\( \\neg V \\)) is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
