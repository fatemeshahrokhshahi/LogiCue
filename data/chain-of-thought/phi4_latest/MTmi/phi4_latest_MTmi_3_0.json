If \\( \\neg M \\) were true, then \\( J \\rightarrow M \\) would imply that \\( J \\) cannot be true because if \\( J \\) were true, \\( M \\) must also be true (contradicting \\( \\neg M \\)).\n\n- Therefore, the possibility of \\( \\neg M \\) being true implies that \\( J \\) must be false to avoid contradiction. This is because if \\( J \\) were true, it would necessitate \\( M \\), which contradicts the possibility of \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nThus, given \"The book might not be a mystery novel,\" we can infer that \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
