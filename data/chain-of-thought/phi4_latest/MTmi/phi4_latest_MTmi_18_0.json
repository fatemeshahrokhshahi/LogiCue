            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. \"The truck might not have been metal.\" This suggests the possibility that the truck was not metal, which we can represent as:\n   - \\( \\neg M \\) is possible.\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer \"The doll was not plastic\" (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow M \\) is false only when \\( P \\) is true and \\( M \\) is false. In all other cases (i.e., when \\( P \\) is false or \\( M \\) is true), the conditional statement holds true.\n\nGiven that \"The truck might not have been metal\" (\\( \\neg M \\) is possible), we consider the scenario where \\( \\neg M \\) is indeed true. If \\( \\neg M \\) is true, then for the original conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow M \\) to hold, \\( P \\) must be false (because if \\( P \\) were true and \\( M \\) were false, the implication would not hold).\n\nTherefore, if it's possible that the truck was not metal (\\( \\neg M \\)), then for the original conditional statement to remain valid in this scenario, \"the doll was plastic\" (\\( P \\)) must be false. This means we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nAnswer: yes",
