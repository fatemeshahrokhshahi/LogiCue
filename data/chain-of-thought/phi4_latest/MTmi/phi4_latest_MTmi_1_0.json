            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) stands for \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This means it's possible that Sue was not at the wedding, which can be represented as \\( \\neg S \\) is a possibility.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (\\( \\neg M \\)) from these statements.\n\n- From the first statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there. The contrapositive of this statement is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\). This means if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary could not have been at the wedding.\n\n- Given \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" (\\( \\neg S \\) is possible), we can use the contrapositive. If it's possible that \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not there), then it must also be possible that \\( \\neg M \\) (Mary was not there).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the statements, if Sue might not have been at the wedding, it is consistent to infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
