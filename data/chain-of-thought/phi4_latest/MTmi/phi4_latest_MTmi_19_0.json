            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as:\n   - \\( T \\rightarrow B \\)\n   Where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( B \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" This suggests the possibility of Jen not watching basketball, which means:\n   - \\( \\neg B \\) is possible.\n\nNow, let's analyze what these statements imply:\n\n- The first statement (\\( T \\rightarrow B \\)) tells us that if Tom did watch football, then it must be true that Jen watched basketball. In other words, the only way for this implication to hold false would be if \\( T \\) were true and \\( B \\) were false simultaneously.\n\n- The second statement indicates that there is a possibility (\\( \\neg B \\)) where Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information:\n\n- If \\( \\neg B \\) (Jen might not have watched basketball) is possible, then for the implication \\( T \\rightarrow B \\) to remain true under all circumstances, \\( T \\) must be false. This is because if \\( T \\) were true and \\( B \\) were false, it would violate the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, since \\( \\neg B \\) is a possibility, \\( T \\) cannot be true without contradicting the first statement. Hence, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
