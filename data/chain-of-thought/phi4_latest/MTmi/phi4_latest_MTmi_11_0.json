The first statement is a conditional: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n   - \\( C \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( C \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The muffins might not have been blueberry.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n   - \\( \\neg B \\) (where \\( \\neg B \\) means \"the muffins were not blueberry\") is a possibility.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- From the first statement (\\( C \\rightarrow B \\)), we know that if \\( C \\) is true (the cake was chocolate), then \\( B \\) must also be true (the muffins were blueberry). This means that if the cake was chocolate, it logically follows that the muffins had to be blueberry.\n\n- The second statement tells us that it's possible for \\( \\neg B \\) to be true. If \\( \\neg B \\) is indeed true (the muffins were not blueberry), then from the first statement (\\( C \\rightarrow B \\)), we can infer that \\( C \\) must be false because if \\( C \\) were true, \\( B \\) would have to be true as well, which contradicts \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nTherefore, given that \"the muffins might not have been blueberry\" (i.e., it's possible for \\( \\neg B \\) to be true), we can infer that the cake was not chocolate (\\( \\neg C \\)) because if the cake were chocolate, then the muffins would necessarily have been blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
