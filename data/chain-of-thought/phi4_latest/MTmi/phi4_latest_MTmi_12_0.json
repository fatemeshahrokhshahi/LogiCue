            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \\( J \\rightarrow L \\), where \\( J \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( L \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\" This suggests that it's possible Lucy did not go to the zoo, which can be represented as \\( \\neg L \\) is a possibility.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" (\\( \\neg J \\)) from these statements.\n\n- The first statement \\( J \\rightarrow L \\) means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. In logical terms, this implies that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( L \\) must also be true.\n  \n- The second statement indicates that it's possible for \\( \\neg L \\) (Lucy did not go to the zoo) to be true.\n\nIf Lucy might not have gone to the zoo (\\( \\neg L \\) is a possibility), and if Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo according to the first statement. This creates a contradiction because \\( J \\rightarrow L \\) cannot hold if \\( \\neg L \\) is possible.\n\nTherefore, for there to be no contradiction, \\( J \\) (Joe went to the park) must be false, which means Joe did not go to the park (\\( \\neg J \\)).\n\nAnswer: yes",
