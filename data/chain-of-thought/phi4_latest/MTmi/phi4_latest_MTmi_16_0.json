            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as:\n   - If P (the shirt is cotton), then Q (the pants are denim). Symbolically, this is \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n2. \"The pants might not have been denim\" suggests that it's possible for the pants to not be denim. This means that Q could be false.\n\nNow, let's analyze what happens if we assume P (the shirt is cotton) is true:\n\n- If P is true, then according to \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), Q must also be true (the pants are denim).\n- However, the second statement tells us that it's possible for Q to be false (the pants might not have been denim).\n\nThis creates a contradiction if we assume P is true because:\n- If P is true, then Q must be true.\n- But Q being false is also a possibility.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, P cannot be true. Therefore, the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
