            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \\( L \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This suggests that it's possible Mark did not buy the blue shirt, which means \\( \\neg M \\) (not \\( M \\)) is a possibility.\n\nIn logic, if we know that \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\) is possible, we can use the contrapositive of the implication to infer something about \\( L \\). The contrapositive of \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\), which means \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nSince it's possible that \\( \\neg M \\) (Mark might not have bought the blue shirt), and given the contrapositive \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\), we can infer that if \\( \\neg M \\) is true, then \\( \\neg L \\) must also be true. Therefore, it's possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nThus, from the information provided, we can indeed infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
