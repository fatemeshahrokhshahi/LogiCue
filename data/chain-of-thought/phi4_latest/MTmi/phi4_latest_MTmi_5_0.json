In all other cases (i.e., when \\( J \\) is false or \\( A \\) is true), the conditional statement holds.\n\nGiven that \"Amy might not have played tennis\" (\\( \\neg A \\) is possible), we consider the scenario where \\( \\neg A \\) is true:\n\n- If \\( \\neg A \\) is true, then for the conditional \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) to hold, \\( J \\) must be false (because if \\( J \\) were true and \\( A \\) were false, the implication would not hold).\n\nTherefore, if it's possible that Amy did not play tennis (\\( \\neg A \\)), then Jeff could not have played basketball (\\( \\neg J \\)) for the conditional statement to remain valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
