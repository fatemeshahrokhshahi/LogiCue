            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \\( B \\rightarrow W \\), where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. \"The wolf might not have been in the den.\" This suggests that it's possible for \\( W \\) to be false, i.e., \\( \\neg W \\) (not \\( W \\)) is a possibility.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave\" (\\( \\neg B \\)) from these statements.\n\n- From the first statement, \\( B \\rightarrow W \\), we know that if \\( B \\) is true, then \\( W \\) must also be true. The contrapositive of this implication is \\( \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\). This means if \\( W \\) is false (\\( \\neg W \\)), then \\( B \\) must also be false (\\( \\neg B \\)).\n\n- Given the second statement, \"The wolf might not have been in the den,\" we understand that \\( \\neg W \\) is a possibility. If \\( \\neg W \\) is true, then by the contrapositive of the first statement, \\( \\neg B \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if it's possible for \\( \\neg W \\) to occur, then it must also be possible for \\( \\neg B \\) to occur. This means we can indeed infer that \"The bear was not in the cave\" is a possibility based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
