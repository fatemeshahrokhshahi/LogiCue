The first statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as:\n   - \\( C \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( C \\) represents \"The car was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"The truck might not have been blue,\" which implies that it's possible the truck was not blue. In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n   - \\( \\neg B \\) is a possibility.\n\nNow, let's consider what these statements imply together:\n\n- From \\( C \\rightarrow B \\), we know that if \\( C \\) (the car was red) is true, then \\( B \\) (the truck was blue) must also be true.\n- However, the second statement tells us that \\( \\neg B \\) (the truck might not have been blue) is possible. This means there's a scenario where \\( B \\) is false.\n\nIf \\( B \\) can be false, then for the implication \\( C \\rightarrow B \\) to hold true in all cases, \\( C \\) must also be false whenever \\( B \\) is false. Otherwise, if \\( C \\) were true and \\( B \\) false, it would violate the implication.\n\nTherefore, since \\( \\neg B \\) is possible, \\( C \\) cannot be true because that would contradict the first statement when \\( B \\) is false. Hence, we can infer that \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
