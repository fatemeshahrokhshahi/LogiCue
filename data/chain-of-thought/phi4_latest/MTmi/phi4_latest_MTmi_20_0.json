The first statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as:\n   - \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"The banana might not have been yellow,\" which implies that it's possible for the banana to be not yellow. In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n   - \\( \\neg B \\) is a possibility.\n\nNow, let's consider what these statements imply together:\n\n- From \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), we know that if \\( A \\) (the apple was red) is true, then \\( B \\) (the banana was yellow) must also be true.\n- However, the second statement tells us that \\( \\neg B \\) (the banana not being yellow) is possible. This means there exists at least one scenario where \\( B \\) is false.\n\nIf \\( B \\) can be false (\\( \\neg B \\)), then for the implication \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) to hold true, \\( A \\) must also be false in that scenario. This is because if \\( A \\) were true and \\( B \\) were false, it would violate the implication \\( A \\rightarrow B \\).\n\nTherefore, given that \\( \\neg B \\) is possible, \\( A \\) cannot be true in those scenarios where \\( \\neg B \\) holds. Thus, we can infer that \"The apple was not red\" (\\( \\neg A \\)) must be true to maintain the validity of the implication under all circumstances.\n\nAnswer: yes",
