    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

Tea is expected to be second in retaining morning drinkers.\n3. Soda is consumed much less in the mornings.\n\nThe logical structure provided states:\n- If tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nWe are also told that coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, which implies that tea won't retain the most morning drinkers. \n\nGiven this setup, we need to determine whether it follows that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nSince coffee is expected to retain the most morning drinkers, the condition where coffee does not retain the most morning drinkers is a hypothetical scenario. However, according to the logical structure provided:\n\n- If tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers (which it won't, because coffee retains the most), then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will indeed retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nThus, given that tea won't retain the most morning drinkers and the conditional statement is true, it logically follows that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: yes",
