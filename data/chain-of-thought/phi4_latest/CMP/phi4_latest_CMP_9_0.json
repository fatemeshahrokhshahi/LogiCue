    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it’s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be. Moreover, it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. Apples are most likely to be the top-selling fruit.\n2. If apples aren't the top seller, then bananas won't be either (since it’s stated that if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be).\n3. The statement \"if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be\" implies a conditional relationship: If apples are not the top seller and bananas are also not, then oranges must be.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- We know that apples have the highest likelihood of being the top seller.\n- The statement \"if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be\" can be interpreted as: If both apples and bananas are not the top sellers, then oranges must be.\n\nGiven this setup, we need to determine whether it is likely that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be. \n\n- The statement \"it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be\" suggests a strong likelihood of apples being on top, reducing the chance for bananas.\n- If apples are not the top seller, then according to the conditional relationship provided, if bananas also aren't the top seller, oranges must be.\n\nThus, the condition \"if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be\" is directly supported by the given logical structure. The likelihood of this scenario hinges on the fact that if both apples and bananas are not at the top, then oranges have to be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
