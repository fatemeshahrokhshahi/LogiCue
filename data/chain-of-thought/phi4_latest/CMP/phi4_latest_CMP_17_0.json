    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will?",

            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. The illnesses in question are flu, common cold, and strep throat.\n2. Doctors expect the flu to infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections being the least prevalent.\n3. If colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will.\n4. It is likely that flu will infect the most, and hence it's unlikely that colds will.\n\nWe need to determine whether it follows that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will.\n\nFrom point 3: If colds don't infect the most people (which they are expected not to), then if flu doesn't infect the most people, strep throat must be the one that does. This is a conditional statement indicating a direct relationship between flu and strep when colds do not have the highest infection rate.\n\nFrom point 4: It's likely that flu will infect the most patients, which implies it's unlikely for either common cold or strep to surpass flu in terms of infections.\n\nNow, consider the scenario where flu does not infect the most people. According to point 3, if this happens and given that colds are expected not to be the most prevalent (as per point 4), then by elimination, strep throat must be the one with the highest infection rate.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure provided in the premises, it indeed follows that if flu doesn’t infect the most people, then it is likely that strep will. The conditions set up a clear chain of reasoning where flu not being the most prevalent directly leads to strep being the most prevalent when colds are already expected not to be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
