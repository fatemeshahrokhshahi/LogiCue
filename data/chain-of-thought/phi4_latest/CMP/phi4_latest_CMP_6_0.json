    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny’s album doesn’t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift’s doesn’t, Beyonce’s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift’s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. **Top-Selling Albums**: The top-selling albums are by Taylor Swift (T), Bad Bunny (B), and Beyoncé (Y).\n\n2. **Sales Projections**:\n   - It is likely that T sells the most copies.\n   - B follows closely, but Y's sales are far behind.\n\n3. **Logical Implications**:\n   - If B doesn't sell the most, then if T doesn't sell the most, Y will.\n   - Since it's likely that T sells the most, it implies that B is unlikely to sell the most.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - We need to determine if it follows that it's likely that if T doesn't sell the most, Y will.\n\nGiven:\n- If B doesn't sell the most (which is likely since T is expected to), then if T doesn't sell the most, Y must.\n- Since it's likely that T sells the most, B not selling the most is a probable scenario.\n- Therefore, in the scenario where T doesn't sell the most, the condition implies Y will.\n\nThus, it follows from the given conditions and logical implications that it is indeed likely that if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, Beyoncé's will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
