    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. **Job Growth Ranking**: \n   - Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs.\n   - Georgia is expected to be second in job growth.\n   - Missouri has significantly lower job growth compared to Tennessee and Georgia.\n\n2. **Conditional Statements**:\n   - If Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will.\n   - Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, implying that it's unlikely for Georgia or Missouri to surpass Tennessee in job additions.\n\n3. **Logical Implications**:\n   - Since Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, the scenario where Tennessee does not add the most jobs becomes less probable.\n   - The statement \"if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will\" suggests a conditional relationship: If both Tennessee and Georgia do not lead in job growth, then Missouri must be leading.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that Tennessee is very likely to add the most jobs, the condition where Tennessee does not add the most jobs becomes unlikely.\n   - However, if we consider the hypothetical scenario where Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, the given conditional statement directly implies that Missouri will then add the most jobs.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure provided, it follows that if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, then Missouri will likely do so.\n\nAnswer: yes",
