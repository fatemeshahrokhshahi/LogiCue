    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. The stock market is expected to see the highest returns, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns.\n2. If real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will.\n3. Stocks are likely to have the highest returns, so real estate won't.\n\nWe need to determine whether it follows that if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will.\n\n- According to point 1, stocks are expected to have the highest returns. If they do not, then by elimination, either real estate or bonds must have the highest returns.\n  \n- Point 2 states: \"If real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will.\" This is a conditional statement that implies:\n  - If real estate does not have the highest returns (which it won't, according to point 3), and\n  - If stocks do not have the highest returns,\n  - Then bonds must have the highest returns.\n\n- Point 3 confirms that stocks are likely to have the highest returns, so real estate will not. This aligns with the condition in point 2.\n\nGiven these points, if stocks don't have the highest returns, then by the logic provided (since real estate won't), bonds must have the highest returns.\n\nAnswer: yes",
