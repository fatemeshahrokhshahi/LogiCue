    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. Pizza is most likely to be the top takeout item, followed by burgers, with tacos being much less frequently ordered.\n2. The statement \"if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be\" implies a conditional relationship:\n   - If burgers are not first, and pizza is also not first, then tacos must be first.\n\n3. It's stated that \"pizza likely will lead takeout orders,\" which means it has a high probability of being the top item.\n4. Consequently, \"hence burgers likely won’t\" suggests that if pizza leads, burgers do not, reinforcing the idea that pizza is more popular than burgers.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether it follows that \"if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be.\"\n\n- If pizza is not first, then according to the initial condition, either burgers or tacos must be first.\n- The statement implies that if both pizza and burgers are not first, tacos must be first.\n\nGiven that pizza is most likely to lead, the scenario where it doesn't leads us to consider the next possibilities: burgers or tacos. However, the conditional logic provided states that if pizza isn’t first and burgers aren’t either, then tacos will be first.\n\nThus, based on the given conditions, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, it is indeed likely (given the constraints) that tacos will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
