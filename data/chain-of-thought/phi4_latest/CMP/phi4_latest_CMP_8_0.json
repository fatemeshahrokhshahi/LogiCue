    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

Economists project that India's economy is likely to grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia lagging behind.\n2. The statement \"if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be\" implies a conditional relationship:\n   - If China is not the top-growing (which it won't be since India is projected to grow fastest), then we consider the scenario where India also isn't the top-growing.\n   - In that case, according to the statement, Russia must be the top-growing.\n\n3. The additional information states that \"India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't.\" This reinforces that India is projected to be the top-growing economy.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?\n\n- The statement given (\"if China is not the top-growing... then if India isn’t, Russia will be\") directly addresses this scenario. It sets up a logical chain where:\n  - If China is not the top (which we know it won't be), and\n  - If India also isn't the top,\n  - Then Russia must be the top.\n\nThus, based on the given conditions and logical structure, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, then according to the statement provided, Russia will indeed be the top-growing. \n\nAnswer: yes",
