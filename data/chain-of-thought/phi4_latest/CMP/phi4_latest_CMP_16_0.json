    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. **Ridership Data**: \n   - Uber is expected to have the most rides.\n   - Lyft follows with fewer rides than Uber.\n   - Taxis have significantly fewer rides than both Uber and Lyft.\n\n2. **Logical Implications**:\n   - If Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides.\n   - This can be expressed as: \n     \\[\n     (\\neg L) \\rightarrow ((\\neg U) \\rightarrow T)\n     \\]\n     where \\(L\\) is \"Lyft gives the most rides\", \\(U\\) is \"Uber gives the most rides\", and \\(T\\) is \"taxis give the most rides\".\n\n3. **Likelihoods**:\n   - Uber likely will give the most rides, so it's unlikely that Uber doesn't give the most rides.\n   - Consequently, Lyft likely won’t give the most rides.\n\n4. **Analysis of the Conditional Statement**:\n   - We need to determine if it’s likely that if Uber doesn’t give the most rides (\\(\\neg U\\)), then taxis will give the most rides (\\(T\\)).\n   - From the logical implication \\((\\neg L) \\rightarrow ((\\neg U) \\rightarrow T)\\), we know that if Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then the condition \\((\\neg U) \\rightarrow T\\) holds true.\n   - Since Uber is likely to give the most rides, it's unlikely that \\(\\neg U\\) occurs. However, if \\(\\neg U\\) does occur, given that Lyft also likely won’t give the most rides (\\(\\neg L\\)), the implication ensures that taxis will give the most rides.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The statement \"if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, then taxis will\" is supported by the logical structure provided.\n   - Given the likelihoods and implications, it follows that if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis are likely to give the most rides due to the conditions set.\n\nAnswer: yes",
