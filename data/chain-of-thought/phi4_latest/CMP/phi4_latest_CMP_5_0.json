    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",
