The first statement is \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\" This can be represented as a logical disjunction:\n   - \\( P \\lor D \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"The pen is in my bag\" and \\( D \\) represents \"The pen must be on my desk.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg D \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (the pen is in my bag) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism, which states that if you have a disjunction (\\( A \\lor B \\)) and the negation of one of its components (\\( \\neg B \\)), then you can conclude the other component (\\( A \\)). \n\nApplying this to our statements:\n- We have \\( P \\lor D \\) (either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk).\n- We also have \\( \\neg D \\) (it's not the case that the pen must be on my desk).\n\nBy disjunctive syllogism, from \\( P \\lor D \\) and \\( \\neg D \\), we can conclude \\( P \\) (the pen is in my bag).\n\nAnswer: yes",
