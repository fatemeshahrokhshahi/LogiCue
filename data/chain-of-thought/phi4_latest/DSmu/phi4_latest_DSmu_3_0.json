The first statement is \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\" This can be represented as a logical disjunction:\n   - \\( K \\lor C \\)\n   where \\( K \\) represents \"The keys are in the drawer\" and \\( C \\) represents \"The keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nGiven these two statements, we need to determine if we can infer \\( K \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic:\n\n- From the disjunction \\( K \\lor C \\) and knowing \\( \\neg C \\), we apply the rule of disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if you have a disjunction (\\( P \\lor Q \\)) and the negation of one of its components (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then you can conclude the other component (\\( P \\)).\n\n- Applying this to our statements:\n  - We have \\( K \\lor C \\) (either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet).\n  - And we know \\( \\neg C \\) (it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet).\n\nBy disjunctive syllogism, from \\( K \\lor C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\), we can conclude \\( K \\) (the keys are in the drawer).\n\nAnswer: yes",
