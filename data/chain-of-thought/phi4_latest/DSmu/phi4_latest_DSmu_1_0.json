The first statement is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" This can be represented as a logical disjunction:\n   - \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Fido is inside\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This can be represented as a negation:\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (i.e., \"Fido is inside\") from these two statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically the disjunctive syllogism rule, which states that if you have a disjunction (\\( P \\lor Q \\)) and the negation of one of its components (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then you can conclude the other component (\\( P \\)). \n\nApplying this to our statements:\n- We have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden).\n- We also have \\( \\neg Q \\) (It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden).\n\nBy disjunctive syllogism, from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can conclude \\( P \\). Therefore, \"Fido is inside\" follows logically.\n\nAnswer: yes",
