            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \\( B \\rightarrow W \\), where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\" This is a negation of statement \\( W \\), which can be represented as \\( \\neg W \\).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave,\" or \\( \\neg B \\), from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens (a form of argument where given a conditional statement and the negation of its consequent, one can conclude the negation of its antecedent):\n\n- We have \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) (If \\( B \\), then \\( W \\)).\n- We also have \\( \\neg W \\) (Not \\( W \\)).\n\nAccording to modus tollens:\n- If \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) is true and \\( \\neg W \\) is true, then we can conclude \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
