            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin must have taken a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Sam did not take a plane\" (\\( \\neg P \\)) from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, which states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), then \\( \\neg P \\), we can apply this to our situation:\n\n- We have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n- We also have \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nAccording to modus tollens:\n- From \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), it follows that \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and applying modus tollens, we can indeed infer \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
