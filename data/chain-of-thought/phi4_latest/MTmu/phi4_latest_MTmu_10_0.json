            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n   - \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( D \\) represents \"the dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"the cat must have been outside.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The dog was not inside,\" which is \\( \\neg D \\).\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid form of argument in logic, we know that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), then \\( \\neg P \\). Applying this to our statements:\n\n- We have \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) (If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside).\n- We also have \\( \\neg C \\) (It's not the case that the cat must have been outside).\n\nBy modus tollens:\n- From \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\), we can infer \\( \\neg D \\) (The dog was not inside).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
