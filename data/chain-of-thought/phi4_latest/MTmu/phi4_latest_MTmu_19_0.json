            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement which can be represented as:\n   - \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This negates the consequent of the first statement, which can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg J \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Tom did not watch football\" (\\( \\neg T \\)) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is false only when \\( T \\) is true and \\( J \\) is false. In all other cases (i.e., when \\( T \\) is false or \\( J \\) is true), the conditional statement holds true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n- \\( \\neg J \\)\n\nSince \\( \\neg J \\) means that Jen did not watch basketball, for the conditional \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) to hold true (since it must be true in all cases except when \\( T \\) is true and \\( J \\) is false), \\( T \\) must be false. If \\( T \\) were true, then \\( J \\) would have to be true to satisfy the conditional statement, but we know \\( J \\) is false (\\( \\neg J \\)). Therefore, \\( T \\) cannot be true.\n\nThus, from \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) and \\( \\neg J \\), we can logically infer that \\( \\neg T \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
