            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements using logical reasoning:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented in logic as:\n   - \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy must have been awake.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented in logic as:\n   - \\( \\neg M \\)\n   where \\( \\neg M \\) means \"the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake\" (\\( \\neg V \\)) from these statements.\n\nUsing the logical implication \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), we know that this is equivalent to saying:\n- If \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true.\n- The contrapositive of this statement is: if \\( \\neg M \\) (the mummy was not awake), then \\( \\neg V \\) (the vampire was not awake).\n\nGiven the second statement (\\( \\neg M \\)), we can apply the contrapositive:\n- Since \\( \\neg M \\) is true, it follows that \\( \\neg V \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
