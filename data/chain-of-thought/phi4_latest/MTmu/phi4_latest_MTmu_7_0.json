            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement which can be represented as \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris must have finished the race.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\" This negates the consequent of our first conditional statement, which can be represented as \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Alex did not finish the race\" (\\( \\neg A \\)) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic:\n\n- From \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), we know that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must also be true.\n- We are given \\( \\neg C \\), meaning \\( C \\) is false.\n- If \\( C \\) is false and \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) holds, then \\( A \\) cannot be true. This is because if \\( A \\) were true, it would imply that \\( C \\) must also be true (from the conditional statement), which contradicts our given information (\\( \\neg C \\)).\n\nTherefore, since assuming \\( A \\) leads to a contradiction with \\( \\neg C \\), we conclude that \\( A \\) must be false. Hence, \"Alex did not finish the race\" is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
