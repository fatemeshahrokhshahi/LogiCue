            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, let's break down the logical statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck must have been blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \"The car was not red\" from these statements, which in logical terms is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, we know that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), then we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\). Modus tollens states:\n   - If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - And \\( \\neg Q \\)\n   - Then \\( \\neg P \\)\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - We have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue).\n   - We also have \\( \\neg Q \\) (It's not the case that the truck must have been blue).\n\n6. Therefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\), which means \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
