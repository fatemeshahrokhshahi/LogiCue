            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \\( J \\rightarrow L \\), where \\( J \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( L \\) represents \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This negates the consequent of the first statement, which can be represented as \\( \\neg L \\).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" (\\( \\neg J \\)) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow L \\) is false only when \\( J \\) is true and \\( L \\) is false. In all other cases (when \\( J \\) is false or \\( L \\) is true), the conditional statement holds true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( J \\rightarrow L \\)\n- \\( \\neg L \\)\n\nWe know that \\( L \\) is false (\\( \\neg L \\)). For the conditional \\( J \\rightarrow L \\) to remain true when \\( L \\) is false, \\( J \\) must also be false. If \\( J \\) were true and \\( L \\) were false, then \\( J \\rightarrow L \\) would be false, which contradicts our initial statement that it's a valid conditional.\n\nTherefore, the only way for both statements to hold true simultaneously is if \\( J \\) (Joe went to the park) is false. Thus, we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
