            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo analyze this problem, let's break down the logical statements involved:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be represented in propositional logic as:\n   - \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the banana must have been yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The apple was not red,\" which in propositional logic is:\n- \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, particularly modus tollens, we know that from a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and the negation of the consequent \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer the negation of the antecedent \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nApplying this to our statements:\n- From \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) (if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow)\n- And \\( \\neg B \\) (it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow)\n\nWe can apply modus tollens to infer:\n- \\( \\neg A \\) (the apple was not red)\n\nThus, based on the given statements and logical inference rules, we can indeed conclude \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
