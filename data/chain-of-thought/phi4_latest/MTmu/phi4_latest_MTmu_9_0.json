            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n   - \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (\\( \\neg L \\)) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, which states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), then \\( \\neg P \\):\n\n- We have \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt).\n- We also have \\( \\neg M \\) (It is not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt).\n\nApplying modus tollens:\n- From \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg L \\) (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nTherefore, based on these logical deductions, we can indeed infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
