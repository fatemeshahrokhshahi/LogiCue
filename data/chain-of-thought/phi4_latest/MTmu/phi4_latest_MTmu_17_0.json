            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.\" This is a conditional statement which can be represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where:\n   - \\( P \\) = \"Ben ate pasta\"\n   - \\( Q \\) = \"Kate must have eaten the salad\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad\" translates to \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Ben did not eat pasta,\" which is represented as \\( \\neg P \\), from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is false only when \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false. In all other cases (i.e., when \\( P \\) is false or \\( Q \\) is true), the conditional statement holds true.\n\nGiven:\n- We have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n- We also know \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nFrom these, we can use the contrapositive of the implication. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). This means if \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then \\( P \\) must also be false (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg Q \\), by the contrapositive, it follows that \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, from \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad\" and \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad,\" we can indeed infer \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
