This is because an implication \\( J \\rightarrow M \\) is only false when \\( J \\) is true and \\( M \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, given that \\( \\neg M \\) (the book must not be a mystery novel), the only way for \\( J \\rightarrow M \\) to remain valid is if \\( J \\) is false. Hence, we can infer \"The book was not written by James\" (\\( \\neg J \\)).\n\nAnswer: yes",
