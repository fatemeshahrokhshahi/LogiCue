            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" \n   - This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \\( G \\rightarrow U \\), where \\( G \\) represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n   - This is a negation of \\( U \\), represented as \\( \\neg U \\).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest,\" which is \\( \\neg G \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens (a valid form of argument), we know that:\n\n- If \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg G \\) must also be true.\n\nHere's why:\n- Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement (\\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)) is true, and the consequent (\\( Q \\)) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then the antecedent (\\( P \\)) must also be false (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n- Applying this to our statements: \n  - \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest)\n  - \\( \\neg U \\) (The unicorn was not in the forest)\n\nBy modus tollens:\n- Since \\( U \\) is false (\\( \\neg U \\)), and \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) is true, it follows that \\( G \\) must be false (\\( \\neg G \\)).\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
