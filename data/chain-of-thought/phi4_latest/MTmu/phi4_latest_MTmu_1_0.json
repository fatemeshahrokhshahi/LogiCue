            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" or \\( \\neg M \\), from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, we know:\n\n- Modus Tollens states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know \\( \\neg Q \\) (not Q), then you can conclude \\( \\neg P \\) (not P).\n\nApplying this to our statements:\n- We have the conditional \\( M \\rightarrow S \\).\n- We also have \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nAccording to modus tollens, from \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\), we can indeed conclude \\( \\neg M \\). Therefore, it logically follows that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
