            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This is a conditional statement which can be represented as:\n   - \\( A \\rightarrow R \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"the alien visited Mars\" and \\( R \\) represents \"the robot must have visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This negates the consequent of the first statement, which can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg R \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\" from these statements. In logical terms, this is asking whether \\( \\neg A \\) follows from \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) and \\( \\neg R \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) is \\( \\neg R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore:\n\n- From \\( A \\rightarrow R \\), we have its contrapositive: \\( \\neg R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\nGiven that \\( \\neg R \\) (the robot did not visit Jupiter) is true, and knowing that \\( \\neg R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is logically equivalent to the original statement, it follows directly that \\( \\neg A \\) must be true.\n\nThus, we can indeed infer \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
