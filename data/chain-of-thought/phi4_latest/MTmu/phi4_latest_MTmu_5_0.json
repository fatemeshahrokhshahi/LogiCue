            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement which can be represented as:\n   - \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy must have played tennis.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This negates the consequent of the first statement, which can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Jeff did not play basketball\" from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is false only when \\( J \\) is true and \\( A \\) is false. In all other cases (i.e., when \\( J \\) is false or \\( A \\) is true), the conditional statement holds true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n- \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nWe know that \\( A \\) is false (\\( \\neg A \\)). For the conditional \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) to remain true when \\( A \\) is false, \\( J \\) must also be false. If \\( J \\) were true and \\( A \\) were false, then \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) would be false, which contradicts our initial statement that it's a valid conditional.\n\nTherefore, the only way for both statements to hold simultaneously without contradiction is if \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball) is false. Thus, we can infer \"Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
