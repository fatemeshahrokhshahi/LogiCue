            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" can be represented as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta,\" which can be written as:\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\" (\\( \\neg P \\)) from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we know:\n\n- Modus Tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true and \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nApplying this to our situation:\n- We have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n- We are given \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nBy modus tollens, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical deduction using modus tollens, we can indeed infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
