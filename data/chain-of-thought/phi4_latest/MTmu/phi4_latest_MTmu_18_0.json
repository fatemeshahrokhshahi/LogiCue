            "content": "Explanation: \n\nLet's break down the statements logically:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The truck must have been metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic,\" which is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we know:\n\n- Modus Tollens states that if you have a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and you know \\( \\neg B \\), then you can conclude \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nApplying this to our statements:\n- We have \\( P \\rightarrow M \\).\n- We also have \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nBy modus tollens, from \\( P \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed conclude that \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
