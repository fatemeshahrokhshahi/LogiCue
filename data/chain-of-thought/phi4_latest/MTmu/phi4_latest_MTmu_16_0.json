            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This is a conditional statement which can be represented as:\n   - \\( C \\rightarrow D \\)\n   where \\( C \\) represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( D \\) represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim,\" which means:\n   - \\( \\neg D \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" (\\( \\neg C \\)) from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we know:\n\n- Modus Tollens states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know \\( \\neg Q \\), then you can conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nApplying this to our situation:\n- We have \\( C \\rightarrow D \\).\n- We also have \\( \\neg D \\).\n\nBy modus tollens, from \\( C \\rightarrow D \\) and \\( \\neg D \\), we can indeed infer \\( \\neg C \\). \n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical reasoning, we can conclude that \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
