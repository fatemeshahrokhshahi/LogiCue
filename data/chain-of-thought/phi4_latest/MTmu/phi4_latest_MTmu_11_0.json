            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, let's break down the logical statements involved:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n   - \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( C \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" (\\( \\neg C \\)) from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, which states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), then \\( \\neg P \\), we can apply this to our situation:\n\n- We have \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) (if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry).\n- We also have \\( \\neg M \\) (the muffins were not blueberry).\n\nAccording to modus tollens:\n- From \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can infer \\( \\neg C \\) (the cake was not chocolate).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical deduction using modus tollens, we can indeed conclude that \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
