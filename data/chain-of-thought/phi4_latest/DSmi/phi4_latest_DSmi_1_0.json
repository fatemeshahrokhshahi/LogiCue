This is because if \\( Q \\) is false, the only way for the disjunction to remain true is if \\( P \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, given that \"Fido might not be in the garden\" (suggesting \\( \\neg Q \\)), we can infer that \"Fido is inside\" (\\( P \\)) must be true to satisfy the original disjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
