The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red (P), then the truck was blue (Q).\" In symbolic logic, this can be written as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n2. We want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement holds true. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which translates to \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n3. In our case:\n   - \\( P \\): The car was red.\n   - \\( Q \\): The truck was blue.\n\n4. The contrapositive of the original statement would be: \"If the truck was not blue (\\(\\neg Q\\)), then the car was not red (\\(\\neg P\\)).\"\n\n5. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n6. Therefore, given the original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" we can indeed infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
