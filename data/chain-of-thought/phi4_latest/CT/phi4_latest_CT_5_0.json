The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nFor our specific case:\n- The original statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball (\\( P \\)), then Amy played tennis (\\( Q \\)).\"\n- The contrapositive of this statement would be: \"If Amy did not play tennis (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then Jeff did not play basketball (\\( \\neg P \\)).\"\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, we can indeed infer that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
