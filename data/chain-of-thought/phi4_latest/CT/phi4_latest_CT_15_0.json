The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nFor our specific case:\n- The original statement is: \"If Sam took a plane (P), then Erin took a train (Q)\".\n- The contrapositive of this statement would be: \"If Erin did not take a train (\\(\\neg Q\\)), then Sam did not take a plane (\\(\\neg P\\))\".\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, we can indeed infer that if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
