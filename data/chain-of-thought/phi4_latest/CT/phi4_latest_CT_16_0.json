The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants were denim (Q).\" This can be written in logical form as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n2. We want to determine if this implies its contrapositive, which states: \"If the pants were not denim (\\(\\neg Q\\)), then the shirt was not cotton (\\(\\neg P\\)).\" In logical terms, we are checking if \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true given that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n\n3. A fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n4. Therefore, given \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" we can indeed infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
