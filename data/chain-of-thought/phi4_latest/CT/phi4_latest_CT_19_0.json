The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nFor our specific case:\n- The original statement is: \"If Tom watched football (\\( P \\)), then Jen watched basketball (\\( Q \\)).\"\n- The contrapositive of this statement would be: \"If Jen did not watch basketball (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then Tom did not watch football (\\( \\neg P \\)).\"\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, we can indeed infer that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
