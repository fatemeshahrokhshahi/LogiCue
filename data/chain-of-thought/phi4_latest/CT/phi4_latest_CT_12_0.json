This is known as the contrapositive of the original conditional statement. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent; that means if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nTo see why this equivalence holds, consider the truth table for \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):\n\n- If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n- If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is false.\n- If \\( P \\) is false and \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n- If \\( P \\) is false and \\( Q \\) is false, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n\nNow consider the contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\):\n\n- If \\( Q \\) is true and \\( P \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\) is false and \\( \\neg P \\) is false, making \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) true.\n- If \\( Q \\) is false and \\( P \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\) is true and \\( \\neg P \\) is false, making \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) false.\n- If \\( Q \\) is true and \\( P \\) is false, then \\( \\neg Q \\) is false and \\( \\neg P \\) is true, making \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) true.\n- If \\( Q \\) is false and \\( P \\) is false, then \\( \\neg Q \\) is true and \\( \\neg P \\) is true, making \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) true.\n\nThe truth values for both the original statement and its contrapositive match in all cases. Therefore, we can infer that \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" is logically equivalent to the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
