The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic (P), then the truck was metal (Q).\" This can be written in logical form as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n2. We want to determine if this implies the contrapositive of the statement, which is \"If the truck was not metal (\\(\\neg Q\\)), then the doll was not plastic (\\(\\neg P\\)).\" In logical terms, we are checking if \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n3. In logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). This means that whenever the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n4. Therefore, given \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (\\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)), we can indeed infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" (\\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)) because they are logically equivalent statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
