However, it does not specify what happens if \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James,\" which can be expressed as \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nIn logic, \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is known as the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). The contrapositive of an implication is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" we can indeed infer \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
