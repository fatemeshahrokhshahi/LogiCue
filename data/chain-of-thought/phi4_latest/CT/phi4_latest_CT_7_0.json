The original statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" In symbolic terms, we can express this as:\n\n- Let \\( A \\) represent \"Alex finished the race.\"\n- Let \\( C \\) represent \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe given statement can be written in logical form as: \n\n\\[ A \\rightarrow C \\]\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this implication, which is \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\" In symbolic terms, this would be:\n\n\\[ \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\]\n\nIn logic, an implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). This means that if the original statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" we can indeed infer \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
