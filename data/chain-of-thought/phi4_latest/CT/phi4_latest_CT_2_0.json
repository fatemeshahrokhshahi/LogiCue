            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo analyze this logical inference, let's break down the statements using propositional logic.\n\n1. The original statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" In symbolic terms, we can express this as:\n   - \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n   where \\( G \\) represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\" Symbolically, this is:\n   - \\( \\neg U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\)\n\n3. The statement \\( \\neg U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\) is known as the contrapositive of the original implication \\( G \\rightarrow U \\). In logic, an implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n4. Therefore, since \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) is given to be true, its contrapositive \\( \\neg U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
