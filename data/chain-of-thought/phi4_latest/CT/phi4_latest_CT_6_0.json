The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nFor our specific case:\n- The original statement is: \"If Sue chose pizza (\\( P \\)), then Bob chose pasta (\\( Q \\)).\"\n- The contrapositive of this statement would be: \"If Bob did not choose pasta (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then Sue did not choose pizza (\\( \\neg P \\)).\"\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, we can indeed infer that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
