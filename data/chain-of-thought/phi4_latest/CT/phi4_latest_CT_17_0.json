The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nFor our specific case:\n- The original statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta (\\( P \\)), then Kate ate the salad (\\( Q \\)).\"\n- The contrapositive of this statement would be: \"If Kate did not eat the salad (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then Ben did not eat pasta (\\( \\neg P \\)).\"\n\nSince a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
