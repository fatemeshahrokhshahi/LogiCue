This is known as the contrapositive of the original conditional statement. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent; that is, they always have the same truth value.\n\nTo see why this equivalence holds, consider the truth table for \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):\n\n- If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n- If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is false.\n- If \\( P \\) is false and \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n- If \\( P \\) is false and \\( Q \\) is false, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n\nNow consider the contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\):\n\n- If \\( Q \\) is true and \\( P \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\) is false and \\( \\neg P \\) is false, so \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true.\n- If \\( Q \\) is false and \\( P \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\) is true and \\( \\neg P \\) is false, so \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is false.\n- If \\( Q \\) is true and \\( P \\) is false, then \\( \\neg Q \\) is false and \\( \\neg P \\) is true, so \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true.\n- If \\( Q \\) is false and \\( P \\) is false, then \\( \\neg Q \\) is true and \\( \\neg P \\) is true, so \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true.\n\nAs we can see from the truth tables, both \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) have identical truth values in all possible scenarios. Therefore, if \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, then \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
