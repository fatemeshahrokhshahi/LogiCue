            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" from \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry,\" we need to analyze these statements using logical reasoning.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where:\n   - P: The cake was chocolate.\n   - Q: The muffins were blueberry.\n\n2. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" Importantly, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent; that is, they always have the same truth value.\n\n3. Applying this to our original statement:\n   - The contrapositive would be: \"If the muffins were not blueberry (not Q), then the cake was not chocolate (not P).\"\n\n4. Since a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, based on logical equivalence between a statement and its contrapositive, we can conclude that \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" is a valid inference from \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
