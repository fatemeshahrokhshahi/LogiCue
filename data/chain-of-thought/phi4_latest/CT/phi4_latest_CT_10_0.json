The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nFor our specific case:\n- The contrapositive of \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" (\\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)) would be \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\" (\\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)).\n\nSince a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, from \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" we can indeed infer \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
