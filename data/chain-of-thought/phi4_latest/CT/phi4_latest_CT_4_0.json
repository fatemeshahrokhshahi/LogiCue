The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars (P), then the robot visited Jupiter (Q).\" This can be written in logical form as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n2. We want to determine if we can infer its contrapositive, which states: \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter (\\(\\neg Q\\)), then the alien did not visit Mars (\\(\\neg P\\)).\" In logical terms, this is \\(\\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P\\).\n\n3. A fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \\(\\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P\\). This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n4. Therefore, given \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" (\\(P \\rightarrow Q\\)), we can indeed infer \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\" (\\(\\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P\\)) because they are logically equivalent statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
