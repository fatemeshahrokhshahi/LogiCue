            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo analyze this logical inference, let's break down the statements using propositional logic.\n\n1. The original statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, we can express this as:\n   - \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this is:\n   - \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n\n3. The statement \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is known as the contrapositive of the original implication \\( M \\rightarrow S \\). \n\n4. In logic, an implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is true, then \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Therefore, given the truth of \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" we can indeed infer \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
