            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\" from \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" we need to analyze these statements using logical reasoning.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form: If P, then Q.\n   - Here, P is \"the bear was in the cave.\"\n   - Q is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. We want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement can be inferred:\n   - The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n   - In our case, it would be: If the wolf was not in the den (not Q), then the bear was not in the cave (not P).\n\n3. A fundamental rule in logic states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value.\n\n4. Therefore, if \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\" must also be true.\n\nBased on this logical equivalence, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
