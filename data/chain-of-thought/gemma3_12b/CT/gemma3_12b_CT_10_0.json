            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\" We are asked if we can infer \"If not Q, then not P.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nA conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P.\" This is a fundamental principle of logic. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nLet's break it down with an example. Suppose the dog *was* inside. Then, according to the original statement, the cat *was* outside. Now, suppose the cat was *not* outside. This means the cat was inside. If the cat was inside, then the dog could not have been inside, because the original statement says if the dog was inside, the cat was outside. Therefore, if the cat was not outside, the dog was not inside.\n\nTherefore, we *can* infer \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
