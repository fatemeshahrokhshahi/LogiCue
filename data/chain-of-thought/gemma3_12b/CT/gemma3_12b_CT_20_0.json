            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\" This can be written as P -> Q.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is written as ~Q -> ~P. This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nA fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" (P -> Q) is given, we *can* infer \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" (~Q -> ~P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
