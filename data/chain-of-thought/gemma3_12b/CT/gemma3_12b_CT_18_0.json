            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\" This can be written as P -> Q.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic,\" which can be written as ~Q -> ~P.\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the original statement. A fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. That is, if P -> Q is true, then ~Q -> ~P is also true.\n\nTherefore, since we are given \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (P -> Q), we *can* infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" (~Q -> ~P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
