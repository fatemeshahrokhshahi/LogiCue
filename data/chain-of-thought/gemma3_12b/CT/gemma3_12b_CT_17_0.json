A fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. Therefore, if P -> Q is true, then ~Q -> ~P is also true.\n\nSince the original statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" is given, we can infer its contrapositive, \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
