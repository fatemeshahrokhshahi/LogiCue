            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" This can be written as P -> Q.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is written as ~Q -> ~P. This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nA fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" (P -> Q) is given, we can indeed infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" (~Q -> ~P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
