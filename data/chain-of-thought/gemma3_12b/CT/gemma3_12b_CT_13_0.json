            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" This can be written as P -> Q.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\" This can be written as ~Q -> ~P, where ~ represents \"not.\"\n\n~Q -> ~P is the contrapositive of P -> Q. A fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" (P -> Q) is given, we *can* infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" (~Q -> ~P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
