            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den.\" This can be written as P -> Q.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is written as ~Q -> ~P. This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nA fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" (P -> Q) is given, we *can* infer \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\" (~Q -> ~P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
