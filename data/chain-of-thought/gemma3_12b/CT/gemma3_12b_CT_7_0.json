            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race.\" This can be written as P -> Q.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race,\" which can be written as ~Q -> ~P.\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the original statement. A fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. In other words, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (P -> Q) is given, we *can* infer \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\" (~Q -> ~P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
