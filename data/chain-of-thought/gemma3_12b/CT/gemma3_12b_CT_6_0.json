A fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. In other words, if P -> Q is true, then ~Q -> ~P is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since we are given \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" (P -> Q), we *can* infer \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" (~Q -> ~P).\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
