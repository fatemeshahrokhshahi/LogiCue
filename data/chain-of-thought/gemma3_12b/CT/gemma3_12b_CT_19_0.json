            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" This can be represented as ~Q -> ~P, where ~Q means \"Jen did not watch basketball\" and ~P means \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nThe statement ~Q -> ~P is the contrapositive of the original statement P -> Q. A fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. In other words, if P -> Q is true, then ~Q -> ~P is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since we are given \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" (P -> Q), we *can* infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" (~Q -> ~P).\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
