            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written as P -> Q.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is written as ~Q -> ~P. This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nA fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" (P -> Q) is given, we *can* infer \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (~Q -> ~P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
