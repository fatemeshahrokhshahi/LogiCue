A fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. Therefore, if P -> Q is true, then ~Q -> ~P must also be true.\n\nSince the original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is given, we can infer its contrapositive, which is \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
