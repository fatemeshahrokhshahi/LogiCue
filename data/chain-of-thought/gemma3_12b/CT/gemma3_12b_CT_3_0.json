A fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is given, we *can* infer \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
