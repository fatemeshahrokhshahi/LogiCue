            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" This can be written as P -> Q.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" This can be written as ~Q -> ~P, where ~ represents \"not.\"\n\nThe statement ~Q -> ~P is the contrapositive of the original statement P -> Q. A fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. In other words, if P -> Q is true, then ~Q -> ~P is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since we are given \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" (P -> Q), we *can* infer \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" (~Q -> ~P).\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
