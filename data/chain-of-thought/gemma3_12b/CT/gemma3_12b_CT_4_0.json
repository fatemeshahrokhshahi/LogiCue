            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be written as P -> Q.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\" This can be written as ~Q -> ~P, where ~ represents \"not.\"\n\n~Q -> ~P is the contrapositive of P -> Q. A fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since we are given \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" (P -> Q), we *can* infer \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\" (~Q -> ~P).\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
