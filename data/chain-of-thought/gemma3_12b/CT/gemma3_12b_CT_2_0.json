            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written as P -> Q.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest,\" which can be written as ~Q -> ~P.\n\nThe statement ~Q -> ~P is the contrapositive of the original statement P -> Q. A fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since we are given \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" (P -> Q), we *can* infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" (~Q -> ~P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
