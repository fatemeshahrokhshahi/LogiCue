            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement \"If I study hard, I will pass the test\" establishes a sufficient condition for passing the test. Studying hard is presented as enough to guarantee passing. The new statement \"If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test\" introduces an additional condition: the test being in Chinese.\n\nThe original statement doesn't say anything about the language of the test. It's possible that studying hard is only sufficient if the test is in a language you understand. The added condition \"the test is in Chinese\" introduces a factor that could potentially invalidate the original sufficient condition. If you don't understand Chinese, studying hard won't help you pass. Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original. The original statement only guarantees passing *if* you study hard, without specifying any constraints on the test's language.\n\nAnswer: no",
