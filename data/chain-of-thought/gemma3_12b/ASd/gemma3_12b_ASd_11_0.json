            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" establishes a sufficient condition for not being tired: getting enough sleep. It doesn't say that getting enough sleep is the *only* way to avoid tiredness. Other factors can contribute to tiredness, such as physical exertion.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\" This statement introduces a new condition – hard labor – which is known to cause tiredness. The original statement only addresses sleep; it doesn't account for the impact of hard labor. Even if you get enough sleep, doing hard labor is likely to make you tired. Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original. The original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens when sleep and hard labor are combined.\n\nAnswer: no",
