            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement \"If I finish my homework, I can play video games\" establishes a condition (finishing homework) that *allows* for playing video games. It doesn't say that finishing homework is the *only* way to play video games, nor does it say that other events can't prevent playing video games. The new statement \"If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games\" introduces a new condition (computer catching fire) that is not addressed in the original statement. The original statement only guarantees video games *if* homework is finished. The new condition introduces a scenario where playing video games might be impossible (a burning computer would likely prevent it). Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original. The original statement doesn't account for the possibility of a computer fire.\n\nAnswer: no",
