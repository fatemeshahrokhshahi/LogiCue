It doesn't say anything about what happens if the order is placed *and* the item is out of stock. The original statement doesn't provide any information about the impact of the item being out of stock. It's entirely possible that being out of stock would prevent shipping, or that the company has a policy to ship even if out of stock (e.g., backorder). The original statement doesn't rule out either scenario. Therefore, we cannot infer the proposed statement from the original. The presence of 'out of stock' introduces a new condition that isn't addressed in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
