            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the given statements using logical notation.\n\n*   Statement 1: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be represented as: J -> A, where J represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and A represents \"Amy must have played tennis.\"\n*   Statement 2: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be represented as: ¬A.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Jeff did not play basketball,\" which is ¬J.\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, a rule of inference in logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P -> Q) and we know that Q is false (¬Q), then we can infer that P is false (¬P).\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n*   P -> Q: J -> A\n*   ¬Q: ¬A\n\nApplying Modus Tollens, we can conclude ¬J.  Therefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
