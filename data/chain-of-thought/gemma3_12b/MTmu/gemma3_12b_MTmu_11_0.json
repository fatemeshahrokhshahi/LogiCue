            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break this down using logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement, which we can represent as:  C -> B, where C represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and B represents \"the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This is the negation of the second statement, which we can represent as: ~B.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" (~C).\n\nThis situation calls for using *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P must be true.\n\nIn our case:\n* P is \"the cake was chocolate\" (C)\n* Q is \"the muffins must have been blueberry\" (B)\n* We have C -> B\n* We have ~B\n\nTherefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude ~C, which means \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
