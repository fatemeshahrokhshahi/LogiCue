            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"  We can represent this as: G -> U, where G represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U represents \"the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be represented as: ¬U.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest,\" which is ¬G.\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states: If P -> Q is true, and ¬Q is true, then ¬P is true.\n\nIn our case, P is G and Q is U. We have G -> U and ¬U. Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can conclude ¬G.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
