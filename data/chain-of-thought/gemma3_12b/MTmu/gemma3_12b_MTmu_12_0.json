            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be represented as: P -> Q, where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be represented as: ~Q, where ~Q means \"not Q.\"\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park,\" which is ~P.\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, a valid rule of inference. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P is true.\n\nIn our case:\n* P -> Q is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n* ~Q is \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\nTherefore, applying Modus Tollens, we can conclude ~P, which means \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
