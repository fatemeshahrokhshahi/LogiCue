Modus tollens is a valid argument form: If P -> Q is true, and ¬Q is true, then ¬P is true.\n\nIn our case:\n*   P = A (Alex finished the race)\n*   Q = C (Chris finished the race)\n*   We have A -> C (If Alex finished, then Chris finished)\n*   We have ¬C (Chris did not finish)\n\nApplying modus tollens, since A -> C and ¬C, we can conclude ¬A. Therefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
