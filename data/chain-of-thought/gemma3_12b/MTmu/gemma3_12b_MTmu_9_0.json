            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"  We can represent this as:  Lisa (Red) -> Mark (Blue)\n2. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is the negation of \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" We can represent this as: ~Mark (Blue)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (~Lisa (Red)).\n\nThis is a classic application of *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\nIf P -> Q\nand ~Q\nthen ~P\n\nIn our case:\n\n*   P = Lisa (Red)\n*   Q = Mark (Blue)\n\nWe have:\n\n1.  Lisa (Red) -> Mark (Blue)\n2.  ~Mark (Blue)\n\nApplying modus tollens, we can conclude:\n\n~Lisa (Red)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
