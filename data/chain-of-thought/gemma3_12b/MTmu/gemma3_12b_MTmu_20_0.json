            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, which we can represent as:  A -> B, where A = \"the apple was red\" and B = \"the banana must have been yellow\".\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This is the negation of statement B, which we can represent as: ¬B.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer ¬A (The apple was not red).\n\nThis situation is a classic example of *Modus Tollens*. Modus Tollens is a valid argument form in logic that states:\n\nIf P -> Q is true, and ¬Q is true, then ¬P must be true.\n\nIn our case:\nP = A (The apple was red)\nQ = B (The banana must have been yellow)\n\nWe have A -> B and ¬B.  Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can conclude ¬A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
