            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the statements and use logic to determine if we can infer the conclusion.\n\n*   **Statement 1:** \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" We can represent this as: P -> Q, where P = Sue chose pizza, and Q = Bob chose pasta.\n*   **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This can be represented as: ~Q, where Q = Bob chose pasta. This is the negation of Q.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"~P\" (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nWe have P -> Q and ~Q. This is a classic example of *Modus Tollens*. Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P must be true.\n\nIn our case:\n*   P -> Q: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n*   ~Q: Bob did not choose pasta.\n*   Therefore, ~P: Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we *can* infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
