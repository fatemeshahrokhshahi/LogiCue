            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\"  We can represent this as: A -> J, where A = alien visited Mars, and J = robot visited Jupiter.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This can be represented as: ~J.  (The negation of J).\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The alien did not visit Mars,\" which is ~A.\n\nThis is a classic application of *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\nIf P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P is true.\n\nIn our case:\nP = A (alien visited Mars)\nQ = J (robot visited Jupiter)\n\nWe have A -> J and ~J.  Therefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude ~A.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
