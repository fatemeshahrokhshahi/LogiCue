We can represent the given statements symbolically:\n\n*   Let 'D' represent \"The dog was inside.\"\n*   Let 'C' represent \"The cat was outside.\"\n\nThe first statement, \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside,\" can be written as: D -> C.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside,\" can be written as: ¬C.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The dog was not inside,\" which is ¬D.\n\nWe have:\n1. D -> C\n2. ¬C\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P -> Q) and we know that Q is false (¬Q), then we can conclude that P is false (¬P).\n\nIn our case, P is D and Q is C. We have D -> C and ¬C. Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can conclude ¬D.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
