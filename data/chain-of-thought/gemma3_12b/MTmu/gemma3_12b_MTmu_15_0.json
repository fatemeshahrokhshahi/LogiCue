            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\"  We can represent this as: P -> Q, where P = Sam took a plane, and Q = Erin took a train.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\" This can be represented as: ~Q, where ~Q means \"not Q\".\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Sam did not take a plane,\" which is ~P.\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, which is a valid inference rule. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P is true.\n\nIn our case:\n* P -> Q is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\"\n* ~Q is \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\"\n\nTherefore, applying Modus Tollens, we can conclude ~P, which means \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
