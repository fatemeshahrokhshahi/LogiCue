            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This is a conditional statement, which we can represent as: Bear in Cave -> Wolf in Den.\n2. \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\" This is the negation of the statement \"The wolf must have been in the den.\"  We can represent this as: ~ (Wolf in Den).\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave\" (~Bear in Cave).\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of logical inference. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P is true.\n\nIn our case:\nP = Bear in Cave\nQ = Wolf in Den\nWe have P -> Q, and we have ~Q. Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can conclude ~P.\n\n~P means \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
