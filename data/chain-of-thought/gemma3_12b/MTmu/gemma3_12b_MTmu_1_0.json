            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the statements and use logic to determine if we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\n*   **Statement 1:** \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" We can represent this as: M -> S, where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n*   **Statement 2:** \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means Sue was *not* necessarily at the wedding. We can represent this as: ¬(S must have been at the wedding).  The phrase \"Sue must have been at the wedding\" implies that Sue's presence was a necessary condition for something else. However, the negation of this statement means that Sue's presence was *not* a necessary condition. This is equivalent to saying that Sue was not required to be at the wedding. We can represent this as ¬(S).\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications. We have M -> S and ¬S. We want to know if we can conclude ¬M.\n\nThis is a classic example of *Modus Tollens*. Modus Tollens is a valid argument form:\n\n*   If P -> Q\n*   And ¬Q\n*   Then ¬P\n\nIn our case:\n\n*   P = M (Mary was at the wedding)\n*   Q = S (Sue was at the wedding)\n\nWe have M -> S and ¬S. Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can conclude ¬M (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nAnswer: yes",
