            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break this down using logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" We can represent this as: James -> Mystery\n2. \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This is the negation of \"The book must be a mystery novel.\" We can represent this as: ~Mystery.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The book was not written by James,\" which we can represent as: ~James.\n\nWe can use *modus tollens*, a valid rule of inference. Modus tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P is true.\n\nIn our case:\n* P = The book was written by James (James)\n* Q = The book must be a mystery novel (Mystery)\n* P -> Q is our first statement: James -> Mystery\n* ~Q is our second statement: ~Mystery\n\nApplying modus tollens, since we have James -> Mystery and ~Mystery, we can conclude ~James.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
