            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This is a conditional statement, which we can represent as:  R -> B, where R represents \"the car was red\" and B represents \"the truck must have been blue.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This is the negation of the second statement, which we can represent as: ~B.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The car was not red\" (~R) from these two statements.\n\nThis situation calls for applying the logical rule of *Modus Tollens*. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P -> Q) and we know that Q is false (~Q), then we can infer that P is false (~P).\n\nIn our case, P is \"the car was red\" (R) and Q is \"the truck must have been blue\" (B). We have R -> B and ~B. Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can infer ~R.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
