            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be represented as:  Tom (Football) -> Jen (Basketball)\n2. \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be represented as: ¬(Jen (Basketball))\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Tom did not watch football\" (¬Tom (Football)).\n\nThis is a classic application of *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\nIf P -> Q\nand ¬Q\nthen ¬P\n\nIn our case:\n\n*   P = Tom watched football\n*   Q = Jen watched basketball\n\nWe have:\n\n1.  Tom (Football) -> Jen (Basketball)  (P -> Q)\n2.  ¬(Jen (Basketball))  (¬Q)\n\nTherefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude: ¬(Tom (Football)) which means \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
