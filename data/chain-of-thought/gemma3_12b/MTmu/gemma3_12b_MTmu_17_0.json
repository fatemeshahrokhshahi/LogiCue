            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break this down using logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate must have eaten the salad.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\" This can be represented as ~Q, where ~Q means \"not Q.\"\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Ben did not eat pasta,\" which is ~P.\n\nWe have P -> Q and ~Q. This is a classic example of *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P must be true.\n\nIn our case:\n* P -> Q: If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.\n* ~Q: It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\nTherefore, by modus tollens, we can infer ~P: Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
