We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as: V -> M, where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy must have been awake.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as: ¬M.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake,\" which is ¬V.\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, a valid rule of inference. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ¬Q is true, then ¬P is true.\n\nIn our case:\nP = V (the vampire was awake)\nQ = M (the mummy must have been awake)\n\nWe have V -> M and ¬M.  Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can infer ¬V.\n\nAnswer: yes",
