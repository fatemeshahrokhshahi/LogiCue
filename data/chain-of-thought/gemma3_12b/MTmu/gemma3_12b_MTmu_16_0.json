            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break this down using logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This can be represented as:  P -> Q, where P = \"The shirt was cotton\" and Q = \"The pants must have been denim.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This is the negation of Q, and can be represented as ~Q.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer ~P (The shirt was not cotton).\n\nWe have P -> Q and ~Q. This is a classic example of Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P -> Q) and we know that Q is false (~Q), then we can conclude that P is false (~P).\n\nTherefore, since we have P -> Q and ~Q, we can indeed infer ~P.\n\nAnswer: yes",
