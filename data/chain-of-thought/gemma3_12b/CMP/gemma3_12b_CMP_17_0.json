    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements and analyze the logic.\n\n1. **Premise 1:** Flu > Cold > Strep (in terms of prevalence - flu infects the most, then cold, then strep). This is stated as \"the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind.\"\n\n2. **Premise 2:** If colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will. This is a conditional statement: If NOT Cold > Most, then (If NOT Flu > Most, then Strep > Most).\n\n3. **Premise 3:** Flu likely will infect the most. This implies that colds likely won't.\n\nWe want to determine if it follows that \"if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will.\" This is asking us to evaluate the truth of the statement \"If NOT Flu > Most, then Strep > Most\".\n\nLet's analyze this using the given premises. Premise 3 states that flu *likely* will infect the most. This means it's not *certain* that flu will infect the most, but it's the most probable outcome. However, the conditional statement in premise 2 is \"If colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will.\" This is a nested conditional.\n\nIf flu *doesn't* infect the most, then we need to consider what happens according to premise 2. Premise 2 states that *if* colds don't infect the most, *then* if flu doesn't, strep will. Since we are considering the scenario where flu doesn't infect the most, we need to see if the condition \"colds don't infect the most\" is met.\n\nPremise 3 states that flu *likely* will infect the most. This implies that colds likely won't. Therefore, it is likely that colds do *not* infect the most. Since the condition \"colds don't infect the most\" is likely to be true, and we are considering the scenario where flu doesn't infect the most, then according to premise 2, strep *will* infect the most.\n\nTherefore, it follows that if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
