    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn’t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn’t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn’t lead in sales, Honda will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements and analyze the logic.\n\n1. **Premise 1:** Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. This establishes an initial expectation of Ford > Toyota >> Honda in sales.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** If Toyota isn’t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn’t, Honda will be. This is a conditional statement:  If (Toyota is not #1) then (If Ford is not #1, then Honda is #1).  We can represent this as:  ¬Toyota #1 → (¬Ford #1 → Honda #1).\n\n3. **Premise 3:** Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota won’t. This means Ford is likely #1 and Toyota is likely not #1.\n\nWe want to determine if it follows that if Ford doesn’t lead in sales, Honda will.  In other words, we want to know if ¬Ford #1 → Honda #1 is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nLet's analyze. Premise 3 tells us Ford is *likely* to lead. This doesn't guarantee it.  If Ford *doesn't* lead (¬Ford #1), then we need to consider Premise 2. Premise 2 states that *if* Toyota isn't #1, *then* if Ford isn't #1, Honda will be. Since we're assuming Ford isn't #1 (¬Ford #1), we need to see if Toyota is not #1. Premise 3 states that Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota won’t. This means Toyota is likely not #1. Therefore, the condition in Premise 2 is met.  Since Toyota is likely not #1, and Ford isn't #1, then according to Premise 2, Honda will be #1.\n\nTherefore, if Ford doesn't lead in sales, it logically follows that Honda will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
