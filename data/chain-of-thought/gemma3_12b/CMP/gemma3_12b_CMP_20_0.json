    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the argument step by step using logical notation to clarify the relationships.\n\nLet:\n* C = Coffee retains the most morning drinkers.\n* T = Tea retains the most morning drinkers.\n* S = Soda retains the most morning drinkers.\n\nThe given statements can be translated as follows:\n\n1. \"Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings.\" This implies C is likely true, T is likely true but less so than C, and S is unlikely.  We don't need to formalize this as a strict logical statement, as it's background information.\n\n2. \"If tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\" This can be written as: ¬T → (¬C → S).\n\n3. \"Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers.\" This is equivalent to saying C is likely true.\n\nWe want to determine if it follows that \"if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers,\" which is ¬C → S.\n\nLet's analyze the argument. Statement 3 tells us that C is likely true. Therefore, ¬C is likely false.  Consider the conditional statement ¬T → (¬C → S).  Since we know C is likely true, ¬C is likely false.  Let's consider what happens if ¬C is false.  A conditional statement (p → q) is true whenever p is false. Therefore, ¬C → S is true, regardless of the truth value of S.\n\nHowever, we are given ¬T → (¬C → S). Since C is likely true, ¬C is likely false. Therefore, the implication (¬C → S) is true regardless of the truth value of S. Thus, the entire implication ¬T → (¬C → S) is true if ¬T is false.\n\nThe question asks us to determine if ¬C → S follows. We know that C is likely true, so ¬C is likely false. Therefore, the implication ¬C → S is true regardless of the truth value of S.\n\nHowever, the prompt asks if it *follows* that ¬C → S. The given information is:\n1. ¬T → (¬C → S)\n2. C is likely true.\n\nSince C is likely true, ¬C is likely false. Therefore, the implication (¬C → S) is true regardless of the truth value of S. The implication ¬T → (¬C → S) is true if ¬T is false.\n\nThe question asks if ¬C → S follows. Since C is likely true, ¬C is likely false. Therefore, the implication (¬C → S) is true regardless of the truth value of S.\n\nAnswer: yes",
