    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the argument step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1:** India's economy is likely to grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. This establishes an initial ranking: India > China > Russia (where \">\" means \"growing faster than\").\n\n2. **Premise 2:** If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. This is a conditional statement. Let's represent it symbolically:  If (¬China_top) then (If (¬India_top) then Russia_top).\n\n3. **Premise 3:** India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. This means India_top and ¬China_top.\n\nWe want to determine if it follows that if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy (¬India_top), then Russia will be (Russia_top).\n\nLet's analyze this using the given premises.  Since premise 3 states India is *likely* the fastest, we can assume for the sake of the question that India *isn't* the fastest (¬India_top).\n\nNow, let's look at premise 2: If (¬China_top) then (If (¬India_top) then Russia_top). We know from premise 3 that China isn't the top-growing economy (¬China_top). Therefore, the antecedent of the outer conditional is true. This means the consequent of the consequent must also be true. The consequent of the consequent is \"If (¬India_top) then Russia_top\". Since we are *assuming* ¬India_top, then Russia_top must be true.\n\nTherefore, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be.\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
