    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements and analyze the logic.\n\n1. **Premise 1:** Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth.\n2. **Premise 2:** Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower.\n3. **Premise 3:** If Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. This is a conditional statement: If (not Georgia) then (if not Tennessee, then Missouri).\n4. **Premise 4:** Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. This means Georgia will *not* add the most jobs.\n\nWe want to determine if it follows that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will.\n\nLet's use symbols to represent the statements:\n* T: Tennessee adds the most jobs.\n* G: Georgia adds the most jobs.\n* M: Missouri adds the most jobs.\n\nPremise 2 can be rephrased as: T is most likely, G is second most likely, and M is significantly less likely.\nPremise 3: If not G, then (if not T, then M).  ¬G → (¬T → M)\nPremise 4: T and not G.  T ∧ ¬G\n\nWe are asked to determine if ¬T → M is true.\n\nFrom premise 4, we know ¬G is true.  Substituting ¬G into premise 3:\n¬G → (¬T → M) becomes True → (¬T → M). This simplifies to ¬T → M.\n\nTherefore, if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
