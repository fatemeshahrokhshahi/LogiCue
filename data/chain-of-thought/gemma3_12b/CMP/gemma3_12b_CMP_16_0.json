    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the argument step by step.\n\n1. **Premise 1:** Uber likely will have the most rides, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. This establishes an initial ranking: Uber > Lyft > Taxis (where \">\" means \"more rides than\").\n\n2. **Premise 2:** If Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. This is a conditional statement: (Lyft doesn't give the most rides) -> ((Uber doesn't give the most rides) -> (Taxis give the most rides)).\n\n3. **Premise 3:** Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. This combines two statements: (Uber gives the most rides) AND (Lyft doesn’t give the most rides).\n\nWe want to determine if it follows that if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will. This is asking us to evaluate the statement: (Uber doesn’t give the most rides) -> (Taxis give the most rides).\n\nLet's analyze this using the given premises. Premise 3 tells us Uber *likely* will give the most rides. This means it's possible, though not certain, that Uber *doesn't* give the most rides. If Uber doesn't give the most rides, then, according to premise 2, we need to consider what happens if Lyft doesn't give the most rides. However, premise 3 states that Lyft *doesn't* give the most rides. Therefore, we can apply the second part of premise 2: if Uber doesn't give the most rides, then taxis will.\n\nTherefore, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
