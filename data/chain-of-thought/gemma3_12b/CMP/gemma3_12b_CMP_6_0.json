    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny’s album doesn’t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift’s doesn’t, Beyonce’s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift’s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements and analyze the logic.\n\n1. **Initial Projection:** Taylor Swift (TS) likely sells the most, followed by Bad Bunny (BB), with Beyonce (B) far behind.\n2. **Conditional Statement 1:** If BB doesn't sell the most, then if TS doesn't, B will.  We can represent this as: ¬BB → (¬TS → B)\n3. **Additional Information:** TS likely will sell the most, and hence BB likely won't. This means ¬BB is likely true.\n\nWe want to determine if it follows that if TS doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will.  In other words, we want to know if ¬TS → B is necessarily true.\n\nSince ¬BB is likely true (from the additional information), let's substitute that into Conditional Statement 1:\n¬BB → (¬TS → B) becomes True → (¬TS → B).  This simplifies to ¬TS → B.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it *does* follow that if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
