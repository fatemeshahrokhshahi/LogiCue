    "user_prompt": "Suppose that thrillers, romances, and mysteries are the top-selling fiction genres. Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren’t #1, then if thrillers aren’t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if thrillers aren’t #1, mysteries will be?",

Let's represent it symbolically:\n   * R = Romances are #1\n   * T = Thrillers are #1\n   * M = Mysteries are #1\n   The statement becomes:  ¬R → (¬T → M)\n4. **Prediction 2:** Thrillers likely will lead sales, so romances likely won’t. This translates to: T is likely, ¬R is likely.\n5. **Question:** Does it follow that, if thrillers aren’t #1, mysteries will be? This translates to: ¬T → M.\n\nNow let's analyze. We know ¬R is likely.  Let's assume ¬T is true (thrillers aren't #1).  We need to determine if M must be true.\n\nFrom the conditional statement ¬R → (¬T → M), since ¬R is likely true, then (¬T → M) is likely true.  We are given that ¬T is assumed to be true. Therefore, since (¬T → M) is likely true and ¬T is true, then M must be true.\n\nTherefore, if thrillers aren't #1, it follows that mysteries will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
