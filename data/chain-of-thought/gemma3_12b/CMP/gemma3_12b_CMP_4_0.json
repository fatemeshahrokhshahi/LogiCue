    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information and analyze the logical implications.\n\n1. **Initial Likelihoods:** Priya is most likely to get the role, followed by Julian, and Diego is a longshot. This establishes a hierarchy of probability: P(Priya) > P(Julian) > P(Diego).\n\n2. **Conditional Statement 1:** \"If Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will.\" This can be represented as: If ¬Julian, then (If ¬Priya, then Diego).  This is a nested conditional. Let's unpack it. It means that if Julian isn't selected, then *if* Priya isn't selected, Diego *will* be selected.\n\n3. **Further Information:** \"It’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t.\" This means P(Priya) is high, and therefore P(Julian) is low.  Since Priya is likely to get the role, Julian is unlikely to get it.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?\" We need to determine if P(Diego | ¬Priya) is high.\n\nSince Priya is *likely* to get the offer, the probability of Priya *not* getting the offer (¬Priya) is relatively low. However, let's assume, for the sake of argument, that Priya doesn't get the offer.  The second part of the nested conditional states: If ¬Priya, then Diego.  Since we're *assuming* ¬Priya, then Diego *will* get the offer. The initial statement that Julian is second in line is irrelevant because Priya didn't get the offer.\n\nTherefore, if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
