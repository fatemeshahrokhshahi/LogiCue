            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We have two statements:\n\n1. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" This is a conditional statement, which we can represent as: Bear in Cave -> Wolf in Den.\n2. \"The wolf might not have been in the den.\" This means it's possible the wolf was *not* in the den. We can represent this as: ~Wolf in Den (where ~ means \"not\").\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave\" (~Bear in Cave).\n\nWe can use *modus tollens*, a valid form of logical inference. Modus tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P is true.\n\nIn our case:\n* P = Bear in Cave\n* Q = Wolf in Den\n* P -> Q = \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n* ~Q = \"The wolf might not have been in the den.\" (which means the wolf was *not* in the den)\n\nSince we have P -> Q and ~Q, we can apply modus tollens to conclude ~P. Therefore, ~P means \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
