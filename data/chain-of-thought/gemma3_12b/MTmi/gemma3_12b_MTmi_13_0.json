            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This can be represented as:  R -> B (where R = car was red, B = truck was blue). This is a conditional statement.\n\n2. \"The truck might not have been blue.\" This can be represented as: ~B (where ~B means \"not B\").\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The car was not red\" (~R).\n\nLet's consider the contrapositive of the first statement (R -> B). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is: ~B -> ~R (If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red).\n\nWe are given ~B.  Since we know ~B -> ~R, and we have ~B, we can use Modus Ponens to conclude ~R. Modus Ponens states that if P -> Q is true, and P is true, then Q is true.  In our case, P is ~B and Q is ~R.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
