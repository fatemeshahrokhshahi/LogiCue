This is a classic Modus Tollens argument. Modus Tollens states that if P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P must be true.\n\nIn our case:\nP -> Q: If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n~Q: Erin did not take a train.\nTherefore, by Modus Tollens, ~P: Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
