            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as: James -> Mystery.\n2. \"The book might not be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as: ~Mystery (where ~ means \"not\").\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The book was not written by James,\" which is ~James.\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, a valid form of logical inference. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P is true.\n\nIn our case:\nP = The book was written by James (James)\nQ = The book must be a mystery novel (Mystery)\nWe have James -> Mystery, and we are given ~Mystery.\n\nApplying Modus Tollens, we can conclude ~James.  Therefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
