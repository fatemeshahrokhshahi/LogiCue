            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be represented as: Griffin -> Unicorn.\n2. \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\" This can be represented as: ~Unicorn (where ~ means \"not\").\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (~Griffin).\n\nLet's analyze using Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P is true.\n\nIn our case:\nP = Griffin\nQ = Unicorn\nWe have P -> Q (Griffin -> Unicorn) and ~Q (~Unicorn).\n\nApplying Modus Tollens, we can conclude ~P, which means ~Griffin.  Therefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
