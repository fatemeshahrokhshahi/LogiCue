            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This can be represented as: P -> Q, where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n2. \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\" This can be represented as: ~Q, where ~Q means \"not Q.\"\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\" (~P).\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of logical inference. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P is true.\n\nIn our case:\n* P -> Q is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n* ~Q is \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\" (which means Bob did *not* choose pasta).\n\nSince we have P -> Q and ~Q, we can apply Modus Tollens and conclude ~P. Therefore, we can infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\n\n\nAnswer: yes",
