            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented as: P -> Q, where P = \"The doll was plastic\" and Q = \"The truck must have been metal.\"\n\n2. \"The truck might not have been metal.\" This can be represented as: ~Q (not Q), meaning the truck was not metal.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" (~P).\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, which is a valid inference rule. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P must be true.\n\nIn our case:\n* P -> Q: If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n* ~Q: The truck might not have been metal (meaning it was not metal).\n\nApplying Modus Tollens, we can conclude ~P: The doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
