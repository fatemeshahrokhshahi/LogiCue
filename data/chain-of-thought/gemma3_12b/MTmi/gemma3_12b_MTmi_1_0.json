We can use Modus Tollens, which is a valid inference rule. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ¬Q is true, then ¬P is true.\n\nIn our case, P is M and Q is S. We have M -> S and ¬S. Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can infer ¬M.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
