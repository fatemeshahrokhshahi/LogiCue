            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as: V -> M (where V = vampire awake, M = mummy awake).\n2. \"The mummy might not have been awake.\" This can be represented as: ¬M (mummy not awake).\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake\" (¬V).\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, which is a valid inference rule. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ¬Q is true, then ¬P is true.\n\nIn our case:\nP = V (vampire awake)\nQ = M (mummy awake)\nWe have V -> M and ¬M.  Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can infer ¬V.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
