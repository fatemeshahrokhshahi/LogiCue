            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This can be represented as:  If C, then D (where C = shirt is cotton, D = pants are denim).\n2. \"The pants might not have been denim.\" This can be represented as: Not D (pants are not denim).\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" (Not C).\n\nWe can use *modus tollens*, a valid form of logical inference. Modus tollens states: If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false.\n\nIn our case:\n* P = The shirt was cotton (C)\n* Q = The pants must have been denim (D)\n\nWe have \"If C, then D\" and we know \"Not D\".  Therefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude \"Not C\". This means \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
