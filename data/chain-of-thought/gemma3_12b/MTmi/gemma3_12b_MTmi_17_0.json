            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This can be represented as: P -> Q, where P = Ben ate pasta, and Q = Kate ate salad.\n2. \"Kate might not have eaten salad.\" This can be represented as: ~Q, where ~Q means \"not Q\".\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Ben did not eat pasta,\" which is ~P.\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, a valid form of logical inference. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P must be true.\n\nIn our case:\n* P -> Q is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n* ~Q is \"Kate might not have eaten salad.\"\n\nSince we have both P -> Q and ~Q, we can apply Modus Tollens and conclude ~P. Therefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
