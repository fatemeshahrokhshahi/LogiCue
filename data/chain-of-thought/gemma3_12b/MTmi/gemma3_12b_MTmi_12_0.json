            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be represented as: Joe -> Lucy (where '->' means \"implies\").\n2. \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\" This means it's possible that Lucy did *not* go to the zoo. We can represent this as ¬Lucy (where '¬' means \"not\").\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" (¬Joe).\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, which is a valid inference rule. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ¬Q is true, then ¬P is true.\n\nIn our case:\n* P = Joe went to the park\n* Q = Lucy went to the zoo\n* P -> Q is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n* ¬Q is \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" (which means Lucy did *not* go to the zoo).\n\nSince we have P -> Q and ¬Q, we can apply Modus Tollens and conclude ¬P. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
