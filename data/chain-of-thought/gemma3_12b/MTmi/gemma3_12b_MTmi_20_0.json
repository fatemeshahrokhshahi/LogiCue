            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, which we can represent as:  A -> B, where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana must have been yellow.\"\n\n2. \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This means it's possible the banana was *not* yellow.  We can represent this as ¬B (not B).\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The apple was not red\" (¬A).\n\nWe can use the logical rule of *modus tollens*. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (A -> B) and we know that B is false (¬B), then we can conclude that A is false (¬A).\n\nIn our case:\n* A -> B is \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n* ¬B is \"The banana might not have been yellow\" (which means the banana was not yellow).\n\nApplying modus tollens, since we have A -> B and ¬B, we can conclude ¬A. Therefore, we can infer \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
