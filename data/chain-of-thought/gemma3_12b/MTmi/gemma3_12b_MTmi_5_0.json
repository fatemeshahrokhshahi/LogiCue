We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be represented as:  J -> A (where J = Jeff played basketball, and A = Amy played tennis).\n2. \"Amy might not have played tennis.\" This can be represented as: ~A (where ~A means \"not A\").\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Jeff did not play basketball\" (~J).\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, which is a valid inference rule. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P is true.\n\nIn our case:\nP = J (Jeff played basketball)\nQ = A (Amy played tennis)\nWe have J -> A and ~A.  Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can conclude ~J.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
