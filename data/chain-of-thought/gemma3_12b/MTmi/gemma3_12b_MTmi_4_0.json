We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This can be represented as: A -> J, where A = alien visited Mars, and J = robot visited Jupiter.\n2. \"The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\" This can be represented as: ¬J (not J), meaning the robot did *not* visit Jupiter.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\" (¬A).\n\nWe can use Modus Tollens, a valid rule of inference. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ¬Q is true, then ¬P is true.\n\nIn our case:\nP = A (alien visited Mars)\nQ = J (robot visited Jupiter)\n\nWe have A -> J and ¬J.  Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can conclude ¬A (the alien did not visit Mars).\n\nAnswer: yes",
