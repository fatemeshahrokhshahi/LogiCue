We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This can be represented as: Chocolate Cake -> Blueberry Muffins.\n2. \"The muffins might not have been blueberry.\" This means it's possible the muffins were *not* blueberry. We can represent this as: ~Blueberry Muffins (where ~ means \"not\").\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" (~Chocolate Cake).\n\nWe can use *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states: If P -> Q, and ~Q, then ~P.\n\nIn our case:\nP = The cake was chocolate\nQ = The muffins must have been blueberry\nWe have P -> Q, and we have ~Q. Therefore, by modus tollens, we can infer ~P.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
