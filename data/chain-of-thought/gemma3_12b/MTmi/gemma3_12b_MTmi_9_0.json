            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic. We're given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as:  Lisa bought red shirt -> Mark bought blue shirt.  Let's use symbols: R -> B.\n\n2. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This means it's possible that Mark did *not* buy the blue shirt.  This can be represented as: ~B (where ~ means \"not\").\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (~R).\n\nWe can use *modus tollens*. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P -> Q) and we know that Q is false (~Q), then we can conclude that P is false (~P).\n\nIn our case, P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" (R) and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" (B).  We have R -> B, and we know ~B.  Therefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude ~R.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
