We can use Modus Tollens, which is a valid inference rule. Modus Tollens states: If P -> Q is true, and ¬Q is true, then ¬P is true.\n\nIn our case, P is A and Q is C. We have A -> C and ¬C. Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can infer ¬A.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
