L ∨ U\n2. ¬U\n\nFrom (1) and (2), we can use the disjunctive syllogism rule of inference. The disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (A ∨ B) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (¬B), then we can infer the other disjunct (A).\n\nIn our case, A is L, B is U, we have L ∨ U, and we have ¬U. Therefore, we can infer L.\n\nAnswer: yes",
