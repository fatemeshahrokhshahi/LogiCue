S ∨ D\n2. ¬D\n\nFrom (1) and (2), we can use the disjunctive syllogism rule of inference. The disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (A ∨ B) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (¬B), then we can infer the other disjunct (A).\n\nIn our case, A is S and B is D. We have S ∨ D and ¬D. Therefore, we can infer S.\n\nAnswer: yes",
