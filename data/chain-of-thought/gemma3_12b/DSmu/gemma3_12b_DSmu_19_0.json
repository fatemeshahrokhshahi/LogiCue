P ∨ Q\n2. ¬Q\n\nFrom (1), we know that at least one of P or Q is true. Since (2) tells us that Q is false, then P *must* be true to satisfy the disjunction in (1).  If Q were false and P were also false, then the statement P ∨ Q would be false, which contradicts the given information.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that P is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
