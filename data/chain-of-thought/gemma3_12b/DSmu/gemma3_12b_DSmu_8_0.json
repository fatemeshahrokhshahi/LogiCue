            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the statements using logical notation.\n\n*   Let 'P' represent \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n*   Let 'Q' represent \"The remote control is hiding under the couch.\"\n\nThe first statement, \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch,\" can be written as P ∨ Q (P or Q).\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" can be written as ¬Q (not Q).  The word \"must\" implies necessity, but in this context, it's best interpreted as simply stating that it's possible the remote is under the couch.  Therefore, saying it's *not* the case that it must be under the couch means it's not necessarily under the couch.\n\nWe have:\n\n1.  P ∨ Q\n2.  ¬Q\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer P.\n\nFrom (1), we know that at least one of P or Q is true. From (2), we know that Q is false.  If Q is false, and at least one of P or Q must be true, then P *must* be true. This is a classic example of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes",
