C ∨ B\n2. ¬B\n\nFrom statement 1 (C ∨ B), we know that at least one of C or B must be true.\nFrom statement 2 (¬B), we know that B is false.\n\nSince B is false, and we know that at least one of C or B must be true, it *must* be the case that C is true. This is a direct application of disjunctive syllogism. If we have P ∨ Q and ¬Q, then we can conclude P.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
