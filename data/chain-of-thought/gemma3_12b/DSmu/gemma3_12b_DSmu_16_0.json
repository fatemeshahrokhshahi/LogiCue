This means at least one of P or D is true.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk,\" can be written as: ¬D (where ¬ represents \"not\"). This means D is false.\n\nNow, we have:\n1. P ∨ D\n2. ¬D\n\nFrom (1), we know that either P is true or D is true (or both).\nFrom (2), we know that D is false.\n\nSince D is false, and we know that at least one of P or D must be true, it *must* be the case that P is true.  If P were false, then both P and D would be false, which contradicts the first statement (P ∨ D).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag\" (P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
