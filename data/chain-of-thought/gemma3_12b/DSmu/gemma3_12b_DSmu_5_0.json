J ∨ P\n2. ¬P\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that at least one of J or P must be true.  Since statement 2 tells us that P is *not* true, then J *must* be true to satisfy the first statement.  This is a form of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
