            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the given statements using logical notation.\n\nStatement 1: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\nWe can represent this as:  S ∨ T, where S represents \"The book is on the shelf\" and T represents \"The book is resting on the table.\"  The 'or' here is inclusive, meaning it could be on the shelf, on the table, or both.\n\nStatement 2: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\nThis can be represented as: ¬T.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The book is on the shelf\" (S) from these two statements.\n\nWe have:\n1. S ∨ T\n2. ¬T\n\nFrom statement 1 (S ∨ T), we know that at least one of S or T must be true.  Since statement 2 tells us that T is *not* true (¬T), then S *must* be true to satisfy the 'or' condition in statement 1.  Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
