This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two statements must be true.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen,\" can be written as: ¬K. This means K is false.\n\nWe have:\n1. L ∨ K\n2. ¬K\n\nFrom (1), we know that either L is true or K is true (or both).  Since we know from (2) that K is false, the only way for the disjunction (L ∨ K) to be true is if L is true. Therefore, we can infer that L is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
