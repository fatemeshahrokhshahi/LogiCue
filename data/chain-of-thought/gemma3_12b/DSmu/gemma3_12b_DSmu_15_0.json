C ∨ L\n2. ¬L\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that at least one of C or L must be true.  Since statement 2 tells us that L is false (¬L), then C *must* be true to satisfy the \"or\" condition in the first statement.  This is a classic example of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
