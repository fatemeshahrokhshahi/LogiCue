I ∨ G\n2. ¬G\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that at least one of 'I' or 'G' must be true. Since statement 2 tells us that 'G' is false (¬G), then 'I' must be true to satisfy the disjunction in statement 1.  This is a direct application of disjunctive syllogism. If we have P ∨ Q and ¬Q, then we can conclude P.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
