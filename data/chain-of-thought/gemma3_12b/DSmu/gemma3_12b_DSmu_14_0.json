M ∨ F\n2. ¬F\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that at least one of M or F is true. Since statement 2 tells us that F is *not* true, then M *must* be true to satisfy the first statement.  This is a direct application of disjunctive syllogism: If P ∨ Q is true, and ¬Q is true, then P must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The milk is on the counter'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
