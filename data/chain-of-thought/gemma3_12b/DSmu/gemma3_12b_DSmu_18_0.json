D ∨ N\n2. ¬N\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that at least one of D or N is true.  Since statement 2 tells us that N is false, then D *must* be true to satisfy the first statement.  This is a direct application of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The notebook is in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
