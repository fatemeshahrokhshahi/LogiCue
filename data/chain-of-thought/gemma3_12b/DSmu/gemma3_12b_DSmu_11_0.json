Note that \"must be\" implies necessity, but in this context, we can treat it as simply 'is'.\n\nWe are given:\n1. D ∨ P\n2. ¬P\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer D.\n\nFrom (1), we know that at least one of D or P is true.\nFrom (2), we know that P is false.\n\nSince P is false, and we know that either D or P must be true, it *must* be the case that D is true. This is a direct application of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes",
