P ∨ Q\n2. ¬Q\n\nFrom statement 1 (P ∨ Q), we know that at least one of P or Q must be true.\nFrom statement 2 (¬Q), we know that Q is false.\n\nSince Q is false, and we know that either P or Q must be true, it *must* be the case that P is true. This is due to the disjunctive syllogism rule of inference: If we have P ∨ Q and ¬Q, then we can infer P.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
