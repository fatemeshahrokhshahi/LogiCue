This can be represented as (P AND R) -> Q, where R is \"the item is out of stock\".\n\nWe need to determine if P -> Q implies (P AND R) -> Q.\n\nIf P is true, then Q must be true according to the original statement. If we add another condition R, such that both P and R are true, the original statement P -> Q still requires Q to be true. The truth of R does not change the implication that if P is true, Q must be true.\n\nTherefore, if the order is placed (P), then the item will ship (Q). If the order is placed (P) AND the item is out of stock (R), the item will still ship (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
