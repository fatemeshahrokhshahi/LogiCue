The added condition \"and I am wearing earplugs\" introduces a factor that would likely negate or at least significantly reduce the effect of the screaming on my ears. Earplugs are designed to block sound, so if I'm wearing them, the screaming is less likely to hurt my ears. Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
