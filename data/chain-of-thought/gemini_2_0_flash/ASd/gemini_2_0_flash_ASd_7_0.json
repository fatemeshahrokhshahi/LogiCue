The new statement (O AND P) -> K adds an additional condition (P) to the antecedent. If O is true, then K is true, regardless of whether P is true or not. Therefore, if (O AND P) is true, then O is true, and since O -> K, K must also be true.\n\nIn other words, adding an extra condition to the \"if\" part of an implication doesn't invalidate the implication, it just makes the \"if\" part more specific. If the original \"if\" part was enough to guarantee the \"then\" part, the more specific \"if\" part will also guarantee the \"then\" part.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
