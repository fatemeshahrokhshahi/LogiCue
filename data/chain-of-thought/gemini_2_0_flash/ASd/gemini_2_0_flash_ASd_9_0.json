It doesn't say anything about what happens if the essay is well-written *and* late. It's possible that turning in the essay late overrides the \"well-written\" condition and results in a lower grade. The original statement doesn't preclude this possibility. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
