            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement \"If I finish my homework, I can play video games\" establishes a condition (finishing homework) that *allows* playing video games. It doesn't guarantee it. It simply says that finishing homework is sufficient for playing video games.\n\nThe new statement \"If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games\" adds an additional condition (computer catching fire). This additional condition makes it *less* likely that I can play video games. The original statement doesn't say anything about what happens if my computer catches fire. It's possible that even if I finish my homework, a computer fire would prevent me from playing video games. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
