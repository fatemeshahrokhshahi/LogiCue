However, it doesn't say anything about what happens if other factors, like eating junk food, are also present. Eating junk food could counteract the weight loss effects of exercise. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that weight loss will still occur if both exercise and junk food consumption are present.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
