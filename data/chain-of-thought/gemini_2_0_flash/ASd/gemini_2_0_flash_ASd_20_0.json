            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement \"If I take medication, I will feel better\" implies a general relationship between taking medication and feeling better. It doesn't specify the type or condition of the medication.\n\nThe second statement \"If I take medication that expired, I will feel better\" introduces a specific condition: the medication is expired. Expired medication is generally considered less effective or even harmful. Therefore, taking expired medication is unlikely to lead to feeling better and might even lead to feeling worse.\n\nSince the original statement doesn't account for the condition of the medication, and expired medication is likely to have a different effect than non-expired medication, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
