This can be represented as (P AND B) -> C, where B is \"the check bounces\".\n\nWe need to determine if P -> C implies (P AND B) -> C.\n\nIf P is true, then C is true. Now, consider the case where P AND B is true. This means both P and B are true. Since P is true, and we know P -> C, then C must be true. Therefore, if P AND B is true, then C is true.\n\nSo, (P AND B) -> C is true whenever P -> C is true.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
