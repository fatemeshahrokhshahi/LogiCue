            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" implies that getting enough sleep is sufficient to avoid being tired. However, it doesn't say that getting enough sleep is the *only* way to avoid being tired, or that it will *always* prevent tiredness regardless of other factors.\n\nThe second statement \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" adds the condition of hard labor. Hard labor is likely to cause tiredness, even if you have had enough sleep. Therefore, the second statement is not necessarily true, even if the first statement is true. The first statement does not account for external factors like hard labor.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
