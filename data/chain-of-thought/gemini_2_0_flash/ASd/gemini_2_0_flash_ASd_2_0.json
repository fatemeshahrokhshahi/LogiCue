It's highly unlikely that we'll have a good time if a bomb goes off at the concert. Therefore, Q (we'll have a good time) is likely to be false.\n\nSo, we have P is true, R is true, and Q is false. In this case, (P and R) is true, and Q is false. Therefore, (P and R) -> Q is false.\n\nHowever, the original statement P -> Q could still be true in other scenarios. For example, if we go to the concert and no bomb goes off, we might have a good time.\n\nSince we can find a scenario where P -> Q is true, but (P and R) -> Q is false, we cannot infer (P and R) -> Q from P -> Q.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
