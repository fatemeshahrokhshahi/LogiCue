It doesn't say anything about what happens when the garage is flooding. Flooding could easily compromise the safety of the car, even if it's in the garage. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first. The addition of the condition \"the garage is flooding\" introduces a new factor that could negate the safety implied by the car being in the garage.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
