Note that \"might not\" is equivalent to \"not\".\n\nWe want to know if we can infer P from P ∨ Q and ¬Q.\n\nIf we have P ∨ Q, this means at least one of P or Q is true.\nIf we also have ¬Q, this means Q is false.\n\nSince we know that at least one of P or Q is true, and we know that Q is false, it *must* be the case that P is true. This is a form of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
