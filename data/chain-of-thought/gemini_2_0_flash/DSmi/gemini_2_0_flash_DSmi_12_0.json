(J or C)\n*   **Premise 2:** The jacket might not be hanging in the closet. (¬C is possible)\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"The jacket is draped over the chair\" (J).\n\nPremise 1 tells us that at least one of the two possibilities (J or C) must be true. Premise 2 tells us that it's possible that C is false. If C is false, and we know that either J or C must be true, then J must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
