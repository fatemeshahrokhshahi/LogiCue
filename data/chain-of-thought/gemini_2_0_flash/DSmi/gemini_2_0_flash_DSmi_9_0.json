The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor. (Not B)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that at least one of the two possibilities (A or B) must be true. Statement 2 tells us that the second possibility (B) might not be true. If B might not be true, it is possible that B is false. If B is false, then A must be true, because we know that at least one of A or B is true. Therefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
