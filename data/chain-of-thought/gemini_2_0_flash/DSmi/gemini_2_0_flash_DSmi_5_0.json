(This is a disjunction: A or B)\n*   **Premise 2:** The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry. (This means it's possible the cookies are NOT in the pantry.)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nIf the cookies *are* hidden in the pantry, then the first premise is satisfied. However, the second premise tells us that it's *possible* they are *not* hidden in the pantry.\n\nIf the cookies are *not* hidden in the pantry, then, given the first premise, they *must* be in the jar.\n\nHowever, the second premise only states that it's *possible* they are not hidden in the pantry, not that they *definitely* are not. It's possible that both premises are true, and the cookies are hidden in the pantry. In that case, we cannot conclude that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
