This is the form of Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P -> Q) and the negation of the consequent (¬Q), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (¬P).\n\nIn our case, P is B, and Q is W. We have B -> W and ¬W. Therefore, we can infer ¬B.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
