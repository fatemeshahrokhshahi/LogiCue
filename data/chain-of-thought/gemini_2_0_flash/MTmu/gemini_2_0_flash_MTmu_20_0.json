We want to know if we can infer ¬A.\n\nThis is a classic application of Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (A -> B) and the negation of the consequent (¬B), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (¬A).\n\nIn our case, we have A -> B and ¬B, so we can indeed infer ¬A, which means \"The apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
