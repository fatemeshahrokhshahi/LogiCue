            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the logic.\n\n*   **Premise 1:** If the book was written by James (J), then the book must be a mystery novel (M).  This can be written as J -> M.\n*   **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. This means the book is *not* a mystery novel. This can be written as ¬M.\n*   **Conclusion:** The book was not written by James. This can be written as ¬J.\n\nWe have J -> M and ¬M.  We want to know if we can conclude ¬J.\n\nThis is a classic example of *modus tollens*. Modus tollens states that if P -> Q is true, and ¬Q is true, then ¬P must also be true.\n\nIn our case, P is \"The book was written by James\" (J), and Q is \"The book must be a mystery novel\" (M). We are given J -> M and ¬M. Therefore, we can conclude ¬J, which is \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
