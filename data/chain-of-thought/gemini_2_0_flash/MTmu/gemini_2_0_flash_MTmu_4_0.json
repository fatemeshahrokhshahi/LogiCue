If A, then R (A -> R)\n2.  Not R (~R)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Not A\" (~A).\n\nFrom premise 1 (A -> R), we know that if A is true, then R must be true.\nFrom premise 2 (~R), we know that R is false.\n\nUsing Modus Tollens, which is a valid inference rule:\nIf we have A -> R and ~R, then we can infer ~A.\n\nTherefore, from A -> R and ~R, we can conclude ~A.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
