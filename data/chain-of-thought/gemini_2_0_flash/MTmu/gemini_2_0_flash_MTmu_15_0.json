We want to know if we can infer ~P.\n\nUsing Modus Tollens, if we have P -> Q and ~Q, we can infer ~P.\nTherefore, from \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" and \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train\", we can infer \"Sam did not take a plane\".\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
