We want to determine if we can infer ¬A.\n\nUsing Modus Tollens, if we have A -> C and ¬C, then we can infer ¬A.\nTherefore, from \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\" and \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race\", we can infer \"Alex did not finish the race\".\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
