(~A)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Jeff did not play basketball\" (~J).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement. The second statement negates the consequent of the conditional statement. This is the form of Modus Tollens.\n\nModus Tollens states:\nIf P -> Q\nand ~Q\nThen ~P\n\nIn our case:\nP = Jeff played basketball\nQ = Amy must have played tennis\n\nWe have J -> A and ~A. Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can infer ~J, which is \"Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
