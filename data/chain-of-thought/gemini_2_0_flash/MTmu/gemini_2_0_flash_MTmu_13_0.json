(Red Car -> Blue Truck)\n*   **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the truck must have been blue. (Not Blue Truck)\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"The car was not red\" (Not Red Car).\n\nThis is a classic example of *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n*   P: The car was red.\n*   Q: The truck must have been blue.\n\nWe have \"If P, then Q\" (Red Car -> Blue Truck) and \"Not Q\" (Not Blue Truck). Therefore, we can conclude \"Not P\" (Not Red Car).\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
