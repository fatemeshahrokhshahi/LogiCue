(P -> Q, where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate must have eaten the salad\")\n2. It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad. (¬Q)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Ben did not eat pasta\" (¬P).\n\nFrom statement 1 (P -> Q) and statement 2 (¬Q), we can use Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states that if P -> Q is true and ¬Q is true, then ¬P must be true.\n\nIn our case, P -> Q is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad\" and ¬Q is \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad\". Therefore, we can conclude ¬P, which is \"Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
