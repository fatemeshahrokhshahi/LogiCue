(L -> M)\n*   **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Mark bought the blue shirt. (¬M)\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (¬L).\n\nThis is a classic example of *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n\nIf P then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n*   P: Lisa bought the red shirt (L)\n*   Q: Mark bought the blue shirt (M)\n\nWe have L -> M and ¬M. Therefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude ¬L.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
