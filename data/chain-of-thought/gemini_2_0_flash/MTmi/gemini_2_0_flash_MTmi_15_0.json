(P -> E)\n*   **Premise 2:** Erin might not have taken a train. (~E is possible)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude: Sam did not take a plane (~P).\n\nPremise 2 tells us that it's possible Erin *didn't* take a train. This doesn't *guarantee* she didn't, but it leaves the possibility open.\n\nIf Erin *didn't* take a train (~E), then according to Premise 1 (P -> E), Sam *couldn't* have taken a plane. If Sam *had* taken a plane (P), then Erin *would have* taken a train (E). Since we know ~E is possible, then P must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
