(A -> B)\n*   **Premise 2:** The banana might not have been yellow. (¬B is possible)\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"The apple was not red\" (¬A).\n\nPremise 1 tells us that if A is true, then B *must* be true. Premise 2 tells us that B *might not* be true. This means that B is not necessarily true.\n\nIf B is not necessarily true, then A cannot be true. If A were true, B *must* be true, but we know B might not be true. Therefore, A must be false.\n\nSo, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
