(P -> Q, where P = Ben ate pasta, Q = Kate ate salad)\n*   **Premise 2:** Kate might not have eaten salad. (¬Q is possible)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude: Ben did not eat pasta. (¬P)\n\nPremise 2 tells us that it's possible Kate *didn't* eat salad. This means ¬Q is a possibility.\n\nIf Kate didn't eat salad (¬Q), then according to Premise 1 (P -> Q), Ben *couldn't* have eaten pasta. Because if Ben *did* eat pasta (P), then Kate *would have* eaten salad (Q). Since we know Kate *might not* have eaten salad, Ben *must not* have eaten pasta.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
