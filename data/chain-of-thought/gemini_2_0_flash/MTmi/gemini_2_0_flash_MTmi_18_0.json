(P -> M)\n*   **Premise 2:** The truck might not have been metal. (~M is possible)\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" (~P).\n\nPremise 1 (P -> M) tells us that if P is true, then M *must* be true. The contrapositive of this statement is also true: If M is *not* true, then P cannot be true. In other words, ~M -> ~P.\n\nPremise 2 (~M is possible) tells us that it's possible the truck wasn't metal. This doesn't *guarantee* the truck wasn't metal, but it allows for the possibility.\n\nIf the truck wasn't metal (~M), then, based on the contrapositive of Premise 1 (~M -> ~P), the doll could not have been plastic (~P). Since it is possible that the truck wasn't metal, it is possible that the doll wasn't plastic.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
