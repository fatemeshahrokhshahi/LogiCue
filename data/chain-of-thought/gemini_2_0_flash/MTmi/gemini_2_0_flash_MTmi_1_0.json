(M -> S)\n*   **Premise 2:** Sue might not have been at the wedding. (¬S is possible)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude: Mary was not at the wedding. (¬M)\n\nPremise 1 tells us that Mary's presence *implies* Sue's presence. This is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of this statement is: If Sue was *not* at the wedding, then Mary was *not* at the wedding. (¬S -> ¬M)\n\nPremise 2 tells us that it's possible Sue was not at the wedding. This doesn't *guarantee* Sue wasn't there, but it leaves the possibility open.\n\nIf Sue *wasn't* at the wedding (which is possible according to Premise 2), then the contrapositive (¬S -> ¬M) tells us that Mary *wasn't* at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
