This can be represented as: Cotton -> Denim.\n\nStatement 2: The pants might not have been denim. This means it's possible that the pants were *not* denim.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton.\"  This is equivalent to saying \"Not Cotton\".\n\nFrom statement 1 (Cotton -> Denim), we can derive its contrapositive: Not Denim -> Not Cotton.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it's possible that \"Not Denim\" is true.  If \"Not Denim\" is true, then according to the contrapositive of statement 1, \"Not Cotton\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton. Since it is possible that the pants were not denim, it is possible that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
