(Griffin -> Unicorn)\n*   **Premise 2:** The unicorn might not have been in the forest. (¬Unicorn is possible)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude: The griffin was not in the forest. (¬Griffin)\n\nPremise 2 tells us that it's possible the unicorn was *not* in the forest. Let's consider what happens if the unicorn was *not* in the forest.\n\nIf the unicorn was *not* in the forest, then according to Premise 1 (Griffin -> Unicorn), the griffin *cannot* have been in the forest. If the griffin *was* in the forest, then the unicorn *must* have been in the forest, but we know the unicorn was *not* in the forest. Therefore, the griffin *must* not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
