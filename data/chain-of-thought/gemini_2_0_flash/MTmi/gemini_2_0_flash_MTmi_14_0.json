(Bear in cave -> Wolf in den)\n*   **Premise 2:** The wolf might not have been in the den. (Wolf not in den is possible)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude: The bear was not in the cave.\n\nPremise 2 tells us it's possible the wolf was *not* in the den. If the wolf was *not* in the den, then, according to Premise 1, the bear *could not* have been in the cave. This is because Premise 1 states that *if* the bear was in the cave, the wolf *must* have been in the den. Since the wolf *might not* have been in the den, the bear *could not* have been in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
