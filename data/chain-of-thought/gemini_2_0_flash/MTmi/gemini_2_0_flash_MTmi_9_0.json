(Red -> Blue)\n*   **Premise 2:** Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. (¬Blue is possible)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude: Lisa did not buy the red shirt. (¬Red)\n\nPremise 2 tells us that it's possible Mark *didn't* buy the blue shirt. This means the \"Blue\" part of our first premise isn't necessarily true.\n\nIf Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then the first premise (Red -> Blue) tells us that Lisa *couldn't* have bought the red shirt. This is because if Lisa *had* bought the red shirt, Mark *would have* bought the blue shirt (according to the first premise). Since Mark *might not have* bought the blue shirt, Lisa *must not have* bought the red shirt.\n\nThis is an application of *modus tollens*. The general form is:\n\n*   If P, then Q.\n*   Not Q.\n*   Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n*   If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q).\n*   Mark might not have bought the blue shirt (Not Q is possible, and therefore, Q is not necessarily true).\n*   Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
