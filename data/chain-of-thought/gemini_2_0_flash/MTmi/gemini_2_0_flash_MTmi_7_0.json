(A -> C)\n*   **Premise 2:** Chris might not have finished the race. (¬C is possible)\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude: Alex did not finish the race. (¬A)\n\nPremise 2 tells us that it's possible Chris *didn't* finish. Let's consider the possibilities:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Chris did finish the race (C is true).** In this case, Premise 1 (A -> C) doesn't tell us anything definitive about Alex. Alex *could* have finished, or Alex *could* have not finished.\n*   **Scenario 2: Chris did NOT finish the race (¬C is true).** In this case, Premise 1 (A -> C) tells us something important. If Alex *had* finished (A is true), then Chris *would have* finished (C would be true). But we know Chris *didn't* finish (¬C). Therefore, Alex *could not* have finished. This is Modus Tollens: If A -> C, and ¬C, then ¬A.\n\nSince it's *possible* Chris didn't finish, and if Chris didn't finish, then Alex didn't finish, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
