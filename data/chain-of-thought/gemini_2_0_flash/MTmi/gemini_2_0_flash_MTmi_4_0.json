This can be written as A -> B.\n*   **Premise 2:** The robot might not have visited Jupiter. This means it's possible that the robot did *not* visit Jupiter. This can be written as ~B (where ~ means \"not\").\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars (~A).\n\nThe first premise (A -> B) is a conditional statement.  If the condition (A) is true, then the consequence (B) *must* be true.  However, if the consequence (B) is false, then the condition (A) *must* be false. This is called *modus tollens*.\n\nIn our case, we know that it's possible that ~B is true (the robot might not have visited Jupiter). If ~B is true, then A must be false. Therefore, ~A (the alien did not visit Mars) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
