We can represent this as: ¬P(Bob) is possible.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Sue did not choose pizza,\" which can be represented as ¬P(Sue).\n\nFrom statement 1, we have P(Sue) -> P(Bob). The contrapositive of this statement is ¬P(Bob) -> ¬P(Sue). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it's possible that ¬P(Bob) is true. Since ¬P(Bob) -> ¬P(Sue), if ¬P(Bob) is true, then ¬P(Sue) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
