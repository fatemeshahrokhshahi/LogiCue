This can be written as C -> M.\n*   **Premise 2:** The muffins might not have been blueberry. This means it's possible that the muffins were *not* blueberry (~M).\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that the cake was *not* chocolate (~C).\n\nThe statement C -> M is logically equivalent to ~M -> ~C (contrapositive).\n\nPremise 2 tells us that ~M is possible. If ~M is true, then according to the contrapositive of Premise 1, ~C must also be true. Therefore, if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
