            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break this down using logic.\n\n*   **Premise 1:** If Tom watched football (T), then Jen watched basketball (J).  This can be written as T -> J.\n*   **Premise 2:** Jen might not have watched basketball. This means it's possible that Jen did *not* watch basketball (~J).\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that Tom did not watch football (~T).\n\nLet's consider the contrapositive of Premise 1: If Jen did *not* watch basketball (~J), then Tom did *not* watch football (~T). This is logically equivalent to the original statement (T -> J).\n\nSince Premise 2 states that it's possible Jen did not watch basketball (~J), and the contrapositive of Premise 1 tells us that *if* Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football, we can infer that it is possible that Tom did not watch football. However, the question asks if we *can infer* that Tom did not watch football. The fact that Jen *might* not have watched basketball does not *guarantee* that Tom did not watch football. It is possible that Jen watched basketball, and Tom watched football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
