If the truck was *not* blue, then the car was *not* red.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that it's possible the truck was *not* blue. If the truck was *not* blue, then the contrapositive tells us the car was *not* red. Therefore, it is possible that the car was not red.\n\nHowever, Statement 2 only says that the truck *might* not have been blue. It doesn't definitively say the truck *was* not blue. It's possible the truck *was* blue, in which case we can't conclude anything about the car's color.\n\nHowever, if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red. Since it is possible that the truck was not blue, it is possible that the car was not red.\n\nLet's consider a truth table:\n\n| Car Red | Truck Blue | Car Red -> Truck Blue |\n|---|---|---|\n| True | True | True |\n| True | False | False |\n| False | True | True |\n| False | False | True |\n\nThe statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" is only false when the car is red and the truck is not blue.\n\nThe statement \"The truck might not have been blue\" means that the truck could be blue or not blue.\n\nIf the truck is blue, we can't conclude anything about the car.\nIf the truck is not blue, then the car cannot be red.\n\nSince the truck might not have been blue, it is possible that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer:\nyes\n",
