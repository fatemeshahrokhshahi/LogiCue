This can be written as J -> A.\n*   **Premise 2:** Amy might not have played tennis. This means it's possible that Amy did *not* play tennis (~A).\n\nWe want to know if we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball (~J).\n\nThe first premise (J -> A) is logically equivalent to ~A -> ~J (contrapositive).  This means \"If Amy did *not* play tennis, then Jeff did *not* play basketball.\"\n\nPremise 2 tells us that it's possible that Amy did *not* play tennis (~A).  Since ~A -> ~J, if ~A is true, then ~J must also be true. Therefore, it is possible that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
