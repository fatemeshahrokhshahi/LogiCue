            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe statement \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" is of the form \"If not Q, then not P.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nA conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" from \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
