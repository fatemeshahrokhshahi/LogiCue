This can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest\".\n\nThe statement we want to infer is \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\". This can be represented as ~Q -> ~P, where ~Q is \"the unicorn was not in the forest\" and ~P is \"the griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nThe statement ~Q -> ~P is the contrapositive of P -> Q. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if P -> Q is true, then ~Q -> ~P is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
