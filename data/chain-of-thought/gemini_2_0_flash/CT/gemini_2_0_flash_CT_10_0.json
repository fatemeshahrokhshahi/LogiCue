This can be represented as:\nDog_Inside -> Cat_Outside\n\nWe want to know if we can infer \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\". This can be represented as:\nNOT Cat_Outside -> NOT Dog_Inside\n\nThe second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
