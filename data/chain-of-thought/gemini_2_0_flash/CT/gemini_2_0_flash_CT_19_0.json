            "content": "Explanation:\nThe original statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe statement \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nA conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" from \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
