The statement \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
