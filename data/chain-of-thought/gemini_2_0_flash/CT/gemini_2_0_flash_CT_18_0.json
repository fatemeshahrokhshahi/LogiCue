This can be represented as P -> M, where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and M is \"the truck was metal\".\n\nThe statement we want to infer is \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\". This can be represented as ~M -> ~P, where ~M is \"the truck was not metal\" and ~P is \"the doll was not plastic\".\n\nThe statement ~M -> ~P is the contrapositive of P -> M. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
