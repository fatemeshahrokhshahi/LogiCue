The statement \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" is of the form \"If not Q, then not P\". This is the contrapositive of the original statement. A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
