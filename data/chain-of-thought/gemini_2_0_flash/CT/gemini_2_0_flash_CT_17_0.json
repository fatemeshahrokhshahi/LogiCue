The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nA conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" from \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
