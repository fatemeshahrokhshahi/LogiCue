    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n*   **Premise 1:** Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth.\n*   **Premise 2:** Tennessee > Georgia > Missouri (in terms of job growth). This means Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs, followed by Georgia, and then Missouri.\n*   **Premise 3:** If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will. This can be written as: ¬Georgia → (¬Tennessee → Missouri).\n*   **Premise 4:** Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, and hence Georgia likely won't. This can be written as: Tennessee → ¬Georgia.\n\nWe want to determine if it follows that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will. This can be written as: ¬Tennessee → Missouri.\n\nLet's analyze the premises. Premise 2 states that Tennessee > Georgia > Missouri. This means Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs. Therefore, ¬Tennessee is false.\n\nPremise 3 states: ¬Georgia → (¬Tennessee → Missouri).\nPremise 4 states: Tennessee → ¬Georgia.\n\nWe want to prove ¬Tennessee → Missouri.\n\nSince we know from Premise 2 that Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs, ¬Tennessee is false. Therefore, we are trying to prove something based on a false premise.\n\nIf Tennessee does not add the most jobs (¬Tennessee), then according to Premise 3, if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs (¬Georgia), then Missouri will (Missouri). However, we know from Premise 2 that Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs, so ¬Tennessee is false.\n\nSince Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs, ¬Tennessee is false. Therefore, the statement ¬Tennessee → Missouri is false.\n\nHowever, the question asks if it *follows* that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will. Since we know Tennessee *will* add the most jobs, the premise \"Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs\" is false. Any statement that starts with a false premise is considered true in logic.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
