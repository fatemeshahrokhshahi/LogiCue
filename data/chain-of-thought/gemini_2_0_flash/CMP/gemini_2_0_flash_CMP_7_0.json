    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it’s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n*   **Premise 1:** Tidal, solar, and wind are the leading renewable energy sources.\n*   **Premise 2:** Tidal is likely to generate the most electricity, followed by solar, with wind lagging.\n*   **Premise 3:** If solar doesn't generate the most, then if tidal doesn't, wind will.\n*   **Premise 4:** Tidal likely will generate the most, and hence solar likely won't.\n\nWe want to determine if it follows that: If tidal doesn't generate the most electricity, wind will.\n\nFrom Premise 2 and 4, we know that tidal is *likely* to generate the most electricity. However, the question asks what happens *if* tidal *doesn't* generate the most.\n\nPremise 3 states: \"If solar doesn't generate the most electricity, then if tidal doesn't, wind will.\"\n\nPremise 4 states: \"Tidal likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar likely won't.\"\n\nSo, we know that solar likely won't generate the most electricity. Therefore, the first part of the conditional in Premise 3, \"If solar doesn't generate the most electricity,\" is likely true.\n\nNow, we are considering the scenario where tidal doesn't generate the most electricity. In this scenario, the second part of the conditional in Premise 3, \"then if tidal doesn't, wind will,\" becomes relevant.\n\nSince solar likely won't generate the most electricity, and we are considering the case where tidal doesn't generate the most electricity, then according to Premise 3, wind will generate the most electricity.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
