    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it’s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be. Moreover, it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

This can be written as:\n¬(Bananas are top) -> (¬(Apples are top) -> (Oranges are top))\n\nPremise 4 states: It's likely apples will be top, and hence bananas won't be. This can be written as:\nLikely(Apples are top) & Likely(¬(Bananas are top))\n\nWe are asked to determine if the following is likely:\n¬(Apples are top) -> (Oranges are top)\n\nLet's consider the case where apples are *not* the top-selling fruit. According to premise 3, *if* bananas are *not* the top-selling fruit, *then* oranges *will* be the top-selling fruit.\n\nPremise 4 tells us that it's likely that apples are top, and bananas are not. However, we are now considering the case where apples are *not* top. In this case, bananas *could* be top. If bananas *are* top, then the condition in premise 3 (¬(Bananas are top)) is false, and the implication is true regardless of whether oranges are top or not.\n\nHowever, if bananas are *not* top, then premise 3 tells us that if apples are *not* top, then oranges *will* be top.\n\nSince premise 2 states that apples are likely to be top, followed by bananas, with oranges trailing, the scenario where apples are *not* top is less likely. In this less likely scenario, bananas could be top. If bananas are top, then the statement \"if apples aren't top, oranges will be\" is not necessarily true.\n\nHowever, if bananas are *not* top, then the statement \"if apples aren't top, oranges will be\" *is* true.\n\nSince oranges are said to be trailing distantly behind, it is unlikely that oranges will be top.\n\nTherefore, it is not likely that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be.\n\nAnswer:\nno\n",
