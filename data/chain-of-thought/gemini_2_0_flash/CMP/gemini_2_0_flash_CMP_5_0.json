    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

Premise 4 reinforces this by stating Democrats *likely* will gain the most voters, and therefore Republicans *likely* won't.\n\nPremise 3 is a conditional statement: \"If Republicans don't gain the most voters, then if Democrats don't, Libertarians will.\" This can be written as:\n\n¬R -> (¬D -> L)\n\nWhere:\n*   R = Republicans gain the most voters\n*   D = Democrats gain the most voters\n*   L = Libertarians gain the most voters\n\nWe are asked if it is likely that (¬D -> L).\n\nFrom Premise 4, we know that D is likely true and R is likely false (¬R is likely true).\n\nLet's consider the case where Democrats *don't* gain the most voters (¬D). If ¬D is true, then either Republicans or Libertarians gain the most voters.\n\nIf Republicans gain the most voters (R), then the antecedent of Premise 3 (¬R) is false, so the conditional (¬R -> (¬D -> L)) is true regardless of the truth value of (¬D -> L).\n\nIf Republicans don't gain the most voters (¬R), then the antecedent of Premise 3 is true. Therefore, the consequent (¬D -> L) must also be true. This means that *if* Democrats don't gain the most voters (¬D), then Libertarians *will* gain the most voters (L).\n\nSince Premise 3 states that *if* Republicans don't gain the most voters, *then* if Democrats don't, Libertarians will, and we know from Premise 4 that Republicans likely won't gain the most voters, it follows that if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
