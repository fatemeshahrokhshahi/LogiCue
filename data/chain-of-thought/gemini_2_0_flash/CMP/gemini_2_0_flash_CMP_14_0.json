    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

This can be written as:  ¬PL -> (¬MW -> LF)\n*   **Conditional Statement 2:** MW likely will happen, and hence PL likely won't happen. This can be written as: MW is likely, and ¬PL is likely.\n\nWe want to determine if it's likely that, if MW doesn't happen, LF will happen.  This can be written as: ¬MW -> LF.\n\nFrom Conditional Statement 1: ¬PL -> (¬MW -> LF). Since ¬PL is likely (from Conditional Statement 2), it's likely that (¬MW -> LF).\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
