    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

However, the question is asking about the case where India *isn't* the top-growing emerging economy.\n\nFrom conditional statement 1: \"If China is *not* the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn't, Russia *will* be.\"\n\nIf India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, China *could* be. If China *is* the top-growing emerging economy, then the first part of conditional statement 1 is false, and the entire conditional statement is true regardless of whether Russia is the top-growing emerging economy.\n\nIf India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, and China *isn't* either, then conditional statement 1 says Russia *will* be.\n\nSo, if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, either China is, or Russia is.\n\nThe question asks if it *follows* that Russia will be. It does not *necessarily* follow, because China could be.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
