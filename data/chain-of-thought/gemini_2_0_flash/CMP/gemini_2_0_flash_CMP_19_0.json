    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

Therefore, the condition \"rents don't increase the most\" is false.\n\nIn logic, an \"if...then\" statement is only false when the \"if\" part is true and the \"then\" part is false. If the \"if\" part is false, the entire statement is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the \"then\" part.\n\nSince the \"if\" part (\"rents don't increase the most\") is false, the statement \"If rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
