    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Explanation:\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n*   **Premise 1:** Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options.\n*   **Premise 2:** Uber likely has the most rides, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer.\n*   **Premise 3:** If Lyft doesn't have the most rides, then if Uber doesn't have the most rides, taxis will have the most rides.\n*   **Premise 4:** Uber likely has the most rides, and therefore Lyft likely doesn't have the most rides.\n\nWe want to determine if it follows that \"if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will.\"\n\nFrom Premise 4, we know Uber *likely* has the most rides. However, we are asked to consider the scenario where Uber *doesn't* have the most rides.\n\nPremise 3 states: If Lyft doesn't have the most rides, then if Uber doesn't have the most rides, taxis will have the most rides.\n\nPremise 4 tells us that Lyft likely doesn't have the most rides. So, we can assume that Lyft doesn't have the most rides.\n\nTherefore, the first part of Premise 3 is satisfied. So, the second part of Premise 3 must be true: if Uber doesn't have the most rides, taxis will have the most rides.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
