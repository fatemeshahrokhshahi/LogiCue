    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn’t win, then if Spain doesn’t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won’t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn’t win, England will?",

Since Spain, Brazil, and England are the only realistic contenders, either Brazil or England must win.\n\nPremise 3 states: If Brazil doesn't win, and Spain doesn't win, then England will win.\n\nWe are given that Spain doesn't win. So, if Brazil *also* doesn't win, then England *will* win.\n\nHowever, if Brazil *does* win, then England will *not* win.\n\nPremise 2 tells us that Brazil has a better chance of winning than England. Premise 4 tells us that it is likely that Spain will win, and therefore likely that Brazil won't win.\n\nSo, if Spain doesn't win, it is more likely that Brazil will win than England will win.\n\nTherefore, it is *not* likely that if Spain doesn't win, England will win.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
