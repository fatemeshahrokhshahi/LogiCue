    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?",

It establishes a conditional relationship. Since Priya, Julian, and Diego are the only top candidates, this statement means that if neither Priya nor Julian gets the offer, Diego *must* get it.\n\nThe question asks about the likelihood of Diego getting the offer *given* that Priya doesn't get it. We know that Julian is the next most likely candidate after Priya. So, if Priya doesn't get the offer, Julian becomes the most likely candidate. However, the statement \"If Julian doesn't get the offer, and Priya doesn't get the offer, then Diego will\" tells us that if Julian *also* doesn't get the offer, then Diego *must* get it.\n\nSince Julian is more likely than Diego to get the offer, if Priya doesn't get it, it is *not* necessarily likely that Diego will get it. Julian is more likely to get it than Diego. However, if Julian also doesn't get the offer, then Diego will.\n\nAnswer: no\n",
