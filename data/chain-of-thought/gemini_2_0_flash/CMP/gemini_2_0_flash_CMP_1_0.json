    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don’t win, then if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won’t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

(W' -> (L' -> C))\n*   **Likelihood:** Lakers win is most likely, therefore Warriors won't win is likely (L is likely, W' is likely)\n\nWe want to determine if \"If Lakers don't win, Celtics will win\" is likely (L' -> C).\n\nWe know that if the Warriors don't win, and the Lakers don't win, then the Celtics win. (W' -> (L' -> C)). Since W' is likely, then (L' -> C) is likely.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if the Lakers don't win, the Celtics will win.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
