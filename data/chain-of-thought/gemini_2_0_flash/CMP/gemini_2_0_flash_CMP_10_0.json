    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

Let's analyze it.\n\nLet A = \"summer doesn't have the most vacations\"\nLet B = \"spring doesn't have the most vacations\"\nLet C = \"winter will have the most vacations\"\n\nPremise 3 can be written as: If A, then (if B, then C).\n\nThe question asks if \"if B, then C\" is true.\n\nPremise 4 states that spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. This means A is likely true.\n\nIf A is true, then \"if B, then C\" is true *only if* A is always true. However, we only know that A is *likely* true. It is possible that summer *does* have the most vacations.\n\nIf summer *does* have the most vacations, then A is false. If A is false, then the conditional statement \"If A, then (if B, then C)\" is true regardless of the truth values of B and C.\n\nHowever, we are trying to determine if \"if B, then C\" is true.\n\nPremise 3 states that \"if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will.\" This is the only information we have that relates the lack of spring having the most vacations to winter having the most vacations.\n\nTherefore, if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
