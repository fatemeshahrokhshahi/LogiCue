I ∨ G (Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden)\n2.  ¬G (It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'I' (Fido is inside).\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that at least one of 'I' or 'G' must be true. From premise 2, we know that 'G' is false. Therefore, since 'G' is false and 'I ∨ G' is true, 'I' must be true. This is a valid application of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
