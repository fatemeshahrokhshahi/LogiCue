P or Q (Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table)\n2. not Q (It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer P (The book is on the shelf).\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that at least one of P or Q is true. From premise 2, we know that Q is false. Therefore, since Q is false and P or Q is true, P must be true. This is a valid application of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
