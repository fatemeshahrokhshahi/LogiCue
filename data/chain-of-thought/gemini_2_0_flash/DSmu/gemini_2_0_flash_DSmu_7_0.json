P ∨ Q (Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet)\n2.  ¬Q (It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer P (The umbrella is in the car).\n\nFrom premise 1 (P ∨ Q), we know that at least one of P or Q must be true.\nFrom premise 2 (¬Q), we know that Q is false.\n\nSince P ∨ Q is true and Q is false, P must be true. This is because if P were false, then P ∨ Q would be false, contradicting our premise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer P.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
