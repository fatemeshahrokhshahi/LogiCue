C or P (Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry)\n2.  Not P (It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer C (The cookies are in the jar).\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that at least one of C or P must be true. From premise 2, we know that P is false. Therefore, since C or P is true, and P is false, C must be true. This is a valid application of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
