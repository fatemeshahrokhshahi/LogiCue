P ∨ Q (Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen)\n2.  ¬Q (It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer P (The phone is in the living room).\n\nFrom premise 1 (P ∨ Q) and premise 2 (¬Q), we can use the disjunctive syllogism rule of inference. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (P ∨ Q) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (¬Q), then we can infer the other disjunct (P).\n\nTherefore, from P ∨ Q and ¬Q, we can infer P.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
