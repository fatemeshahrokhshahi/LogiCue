P or Q (Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head)\n2.  Not Q (It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer P (The sunglasses are in her bag).\n\nFrom premise 1 (P or Q) and premise 2 (Not Q), we can use the disjunctive syllogism rule of inference. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have \"P or Q\" and \"Not Q\", then we can conclude \"P\".\n\nTherefore, from \"P or Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can infer \"P\".\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
