Let's use logical deduction:\n\n1.  We have P ∨ Q (Either P or Q is true).\n2.  We have ¬Q (Q is false).\n\nSince we know that either P or Q is true, and we also know that Q is false, it must be the case that P is true. This is because if Q were true, then ¬Q would be false, which contradicts our given information. Therefore, P must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
