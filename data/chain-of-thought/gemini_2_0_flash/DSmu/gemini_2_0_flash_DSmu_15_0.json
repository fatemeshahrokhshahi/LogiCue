P or Q (Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door)\n2.  Not Q (It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer P (The shoes are in the closet).\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that at least one of P or Q must be true. From premise 2, we know that Q is false. Therefore, since Q is false and P or Q is true, P must be true. This is a valid application of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
