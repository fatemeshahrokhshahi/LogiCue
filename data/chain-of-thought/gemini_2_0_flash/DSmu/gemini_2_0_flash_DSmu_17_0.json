We have two statements:\n\n1.  \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\" This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two options must be true.\n2.  \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\" This means the second option in the first statement is false.\n\nIf we know that at least one of the two options in the first statement must be true, and we know that the second option is false, then the first option *must* be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
