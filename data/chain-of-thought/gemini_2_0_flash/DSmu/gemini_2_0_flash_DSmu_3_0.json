D ∨ C (Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet)\n2.  ¬C (It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer D (The keys are in the drawer).\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that at least one of D or C must be true. From premise 2, we know that C is false. Therefore, since D ∨ C is true and C is false, D must be true. This is a valid application of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
