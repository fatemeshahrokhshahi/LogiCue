A or B (Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed)\n2.  not B (It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer A (The missing sock is in the laundry basket).\n\nFrom premise 1 (A or B), we know that at least one of A or B must be true.\nFrom premise 2 (not B), we know that B is false.\n\nSince A or B is true, and B is false, then A must be true. This is a valid application of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes\n",
