    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don’t win, then if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won’t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will?",

The Warriors are next in line with a high probability of winning.\n3. The Celtics have much lower odds compared to the Lakers and Warriors.\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n- If the Lakers do not win, it is less likely that the Warriors will either (since they are second most likely).\n- Therefore, if the Lakers don't win, the only remaining contender with significant probability of winning is the Celtics.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze the statement: \"Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will?\"\n\nThe reasoning here hinges on the elimination process:\n1. If the Lakers do not win (which has a high likelihood based on their position in the hierarchy of probabilities), then the Warriors are less likely to win.\n2. With both the Lakers and the Warriors out of contention, the Celtics become the most probable winner.\n\nThus, if the Lakers don't win, it is indeed highly likely that the Celtics will because they are the only other team with significant probability left in the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
