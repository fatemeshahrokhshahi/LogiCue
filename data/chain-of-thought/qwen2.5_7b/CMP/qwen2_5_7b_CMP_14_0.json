    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step:\n\n1. There are three potential new laws: an increase in the minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness.\n2. Only one of these will be passed this session.\n3. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike to be most probable, followed by paid family leave, with student loan forgiveness being much less likely.\n4. If paid family leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\n5. A minimum wage hike is likely to happen and hence paid family leave is unlikely to happen.\n\nFrom point 4: \"If paid family leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\" This can be written as:\n- If ¬(paid family leave) and ¬(minimum wage hike), then (loan forgiveness).\n\nFrom point 5: A minimum wage hike is likely to happen. This means that the probability of a minimum wage hike happening is high.\n\nGiven this information, let's analyze what happens if a minimum wage hike doesn't occur:\n- If a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, and considering it is highly probable (likely) that a minimum wage hike will happen, then paid family leave is unlikely to happen.\n- Since only one law can be passed, the remaining options are either paid family leave or loan forgiveness. Given that paid family leave is unlikely if a minimum wage hike doesn't occur, this leaves loan forgiveness as the most probable outcome.\n\nTherefore, it follows that if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, then loan forgiveness will likely happen.\n\nAnswer: yes",
