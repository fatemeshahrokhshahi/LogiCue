    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it’s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand the logical flow:\n\n1. Tidal power is forecasted to generate the most electricity this year.\n2. Solar power follows tidal power in terms of generation capacity.\n3. Wind power has significantly less capacity than both tidal and solar power.\n\nFrom these, we can infer that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity:\n- It could be because it's not generating as much as expected (which is unlikely given the forecast).\n- Solar power would then have to generate more than its usual amount.\n- If solar power also fails to generate the most, wind power will.\n\nThe key statement here is: \"if tidal power doesn’t [generate the most electricity], if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then wind power will.\" This directly links the failure of both tidal and solar power to the likelihood of wind power generating the most.\n\nAnswer: yes",
