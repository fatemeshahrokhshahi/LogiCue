    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand the logical flow:\n\n1. The stock market is expected to see the highest returns this year.\n2. Real estate follows with the second-highest returns.\n3. Bonds are expected to have significantly lower returns.\n\nFrom these points, we can infer that if stocks do not have the highest returns, then real estate or bonds must take their place as having the highest returns. However, since real estate is expected to have higher returns than bonds, it means that if stocks don't top out in terms of return, bonds cannot be the highest return option.\n\nGiven this setup:\n- If stocks do not have the highest returns (they could still be second or third), then real estate must take the top spot.\n- Only if both stocks and real estate fail to provide the highest returns can bonds potentially become the best-performing investment.\n\nThe statement \"if stocks don’t, bonds will\" directly aligns with this reasoning. If stocks do not have the highest returns, it implies that either real estate or bonds are in first place. Since real estate is expected to perform better than bonds, if real estate does not take the top spot (which would be a surprise given its expected performance), then by process of elimination, bonds must.\n\nAnswer: yes",
