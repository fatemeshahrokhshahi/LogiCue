    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand the logical flow.\n\n1. Economists project that India is likely to grow the fastest among these three countries this year.\n2. China’s growth rate is projected to follow closely behind India's.\n3. Russia's growth rate is expected to be much lower than both India and China.\n4. If China isn't the top-growing emerging economy, then by process of elimination (since India is likely to grow the fastest), it must be Russia.\n\nGiven these points, we can see that if India is not the top-growing economy, there are only two possibilities left: either China or Russia could be in second place. However, since China's growth rate is projected to follow closely behind India’s and is expected to be much faster than Russia's, it makes more sense for Russia to be the slower growing of the remaining options.\n\nTherefore, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, then by elimination, Russia will likely be the next fastest grower. \n\nAnswer: yes",
