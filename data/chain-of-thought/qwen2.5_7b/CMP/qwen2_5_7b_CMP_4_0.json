    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?",

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

If Priya does not get the offer, Julian is next in line to receive it.\n3. If Julian doesn't get the offer (which would only happen if Priya also didn’t), then Diego will get the offer.\n\nGiven these points, we can infer that:\n\n- The manager believes Priya has a high probability of getting the role.\n- If Priya does not get the role, there is a certainty that Julian will not get it either because he is ranked second in likelihood after Priya.\n- Therefore, if Priya doesn't get the offer and Julian also misses out (which only happens when Priya doesn’t), then Diego must receive the offer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
