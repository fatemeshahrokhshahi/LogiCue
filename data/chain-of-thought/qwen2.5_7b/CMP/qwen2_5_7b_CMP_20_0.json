    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end",

Tea is next in line after coffee.\n3. Soda is consumed much less than both coffee and tea in the mornings.\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n- If coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then it must be either tea or soda that does so (since they are the only options).\n- Given that tea likely won’t retain the most morning drinkers if coffee doesn't, this leaves soda as the only other option.\n\nThe key statement is: \"If tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\"\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n- If not (coffee retains), and not (tea retains), then soda retains.\n\nSince we are given that it's likely coffee will retain the most morning drinkers, which implies tea won't. Therefore, if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, by process of elimination, soda must.\n\nAnswer: yes",
