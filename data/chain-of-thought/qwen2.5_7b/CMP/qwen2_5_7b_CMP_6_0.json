    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny’s album doesn’t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift’s doesn’t, Beyonce’s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift’s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand the logical flow:\n\n1. Taylor Swift (TS) is projected to sell the most albums.\n2. Bad Bunny (BB) is projected to come in second.\n3. Beyonce (B) is far behind and expected to have a lower sales volume.\n\nGiven these projections, we can infer:\n- If TS's album doesn't sell the most, then BB’s won’t either because he is projected to be second.\n- Since BB’s album isn’t selling the most, B’s album must take the remaining position as it is far behind and thus has a higher chance of being third.\n\nThe statement we need to evaluate is: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?\"\n\nFrom our initial projections:\n- If TS’s album sells the most (most likely), BB’s won’t.\n- Therefore, if TS’s album does not sell the most, then BB’s must be in second place.\n\nSince B is far behind and only comes into play when neither TS nor BB are leading, it follows that if TS doesn't lead, B will indeed take the third position.\n\nAnswer: yes",
