    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand their implications:\n\n1. Pizza is expected to be the most frequently ordered food.\n2. Burgers are next in line after pizza.\n3. Tacos are ordered much less frequently than both pizza and burgers.\n\nFrom these points, we can infer that if pizza isn't the top takeout item:\n- Since pizza is still likely to be more popular than tacos (but not necessarily as much as burgers), it's unlikely that tacos will become the most popular.\n- The statement suggests that if burgers aren’t the top takeout item, then tacos will be. However, this is conditional on the absence of both pizza and burgers being the top choice.\n\nGiven that:\n- Pizza is likely to remain the top choice,\n- If not, it implies a scenario where neither pizza nor burgers are at the top.\n- In such a case, tacos would become the most popular due to their lower frequency compared to the other two options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
