    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

Republicans are likely to gain more voters than Libertarians but fewer than Democrats.\n3. These are the only major parties considered.\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n- If Democrats don’t gain the most voters, then either Republicans or Libertarians will (since they are the only other options).\n- Given that Democrats are expected to gain the most, it is less likely for Republicans to do so; hence, if Democrats don't lead, Republicans also won't.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination and given the likelihood rankings:\n- If Democrats don’t gain the most voters, then Republicans will not either.\n- This leaves Libertarians as the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
