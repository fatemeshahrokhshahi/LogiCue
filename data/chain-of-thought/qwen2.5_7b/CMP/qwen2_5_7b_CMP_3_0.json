    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn’t win, then if Spain doesn’t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won’t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn’t win, England will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step.\n\n1. The best chances to win are for Spain, followed closely by Brazil, with much lower odds for England.\n2. If Brazil does not win, and Spain does not win, then it is implied that England would win (since they have the only realistic chances left).\n3. It's likely that Spain will win, which means there's a high probability that Brazil won't win.\n\nGiven these points, we need to determine if it follows that it is likely that, if Spain doesn’t win, England will.\n\n- If Spain does not win, and considering the given odds, the only other realistic chance left would be for England.\n- The statement \"it's likely that Spain will win\" implies a high probability of Spain winning. Therefore, there must also be a lower likelihood of Spain not winning (since these are the best chances).\n\nGiven this reasoning, if Spain does not win, then it is highly probable that England will win because Brazil’s odds are close to Spain's and they would likely take the opportunity.\n\nAnswer: yes",
