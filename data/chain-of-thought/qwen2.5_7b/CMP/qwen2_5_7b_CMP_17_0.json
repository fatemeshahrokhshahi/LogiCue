    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the logic step by step.\n\n1. The illnesses in question are ranked as follows:\n   - Flu is expected to infect the most patients.\n   - Common cold is next.\n   - Strep throat is last.\n\n2. If the flu doesn't infect the most people, then according to the given information, it must be that either the common cold or strep throat does so because these are the only major illnesses spreading and they cover all possibilities.\n\n3. The statement \"if colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the flu doesn't infect the most (and thus it's not the case that the common cold does), then by elimination, strep must be the one to infect the most.\n\n4. The additional information \"flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won’t\" further supports this logic because it reinforces that if the flu doesn't infect the most, the common cold also can't do so, leaving only strep as a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
