            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\" is a conditional statement which can be written as \\( B \\rightarrow W \\), where \\( B \\) stands for \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) stands for \"the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n\n2. The second statement says, \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den,\" which can be written as \\( \\neg W \\).\n\nTo infer whether we can conclude that \"The bear was not in the cave\" (\\( \\neg B \\)), let's analyze these statements together.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is false only when \\( A \\) is true and \\( B \\) is false. In all other cases, it is true. Given \\( B \\rightarrow W \\), if we know that \\( W \\) (the wolf must have been in the den) is not true (\\( \\neg W \\)), then for the conditional statement to hold, \\( B \\) (the bear was in the cave) must be false.\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can infer that \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
