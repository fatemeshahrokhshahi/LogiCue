            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and see if we can logically deduce the conclusion.\n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" - This is a conditional statement where the antecedent (the part before \"then\") is \"the doll was plastic,\" and the consequent (the part after \"then\") is \"the truck must have been metal.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" - This negates the consequent of the first statement.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement P → Q (P implies Q), and we know ¬Q (not Q), then we can infer ¬P (not P). This is known as modus tollens. In our case:\n- P: \"the doll was plastic\"\n- Q: \"the truck must have been metal\"\n\nGiven that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal (¬Q), by applying modus tollens, we can infer that the doll was not plastic (¬P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
