            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and see if we can logically infer the conclusion.\n\n1. \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" - This is a conditional statement where the antecedent (the part before 'then') is \"the book was written by James,\" and the consequent (the part after 'then') is \"the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\" - This negates the consequent of the first statement.\n\nTo infer whether the book was not written by James, we need to consider the logical structure:\n\n- If A (the book was written by James) implies B (the book is a mystery novel), and it's given that B does not hold (it’s not the case that the book must be a mystery novel), then according to classical logic, this doesn't necessarily mean that A cannot be true. It only means that if A were true, B would have to be true, but since B is false, A can still be false or it could be that the implication does not hold.\n\nHowever, in this specific case, we are given a conditional statement and its negation of the consequent. According to the law of contrapositive, if \"If P then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q then not P\" must also be true. But here, since it's stated that \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel,\" we are directly negating the consequent.\n\nIn formal logic, this situation can lead to an inference using modus tollens: If A implies B and not-B is true, then not-A must also be true. However, in our scenario, it’s more about understanding that if James wrote the book (A), it would have to be a mystery novel (B). Since we know it's not a mystery novel (not-B), this directly suggests that James did not write the book.\n\nAnswer: yes",
