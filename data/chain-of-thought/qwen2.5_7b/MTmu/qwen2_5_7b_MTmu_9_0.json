            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the logic step by step. We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement where the antecedent (Lisa buying the red shirt) implies the consequent (Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This negates the consequent of the first statement.\n\nIn logic, if we know that a certain condition (in this case, Mark buying the blue shirt) is false and there exists a conditional relationship where that condition follows from another event (Lisa buying the red shirt), then we can infer that the initial event must also be false. This is based on the principle of contraposition in logic: if A implies B, and not B is true, then not A must be true.\n\nTherefore, since it's stated that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (¬B) and given that buying the red shirt by Lisa would imply Mark buys the blue shirt (A → B), we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (¬A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
