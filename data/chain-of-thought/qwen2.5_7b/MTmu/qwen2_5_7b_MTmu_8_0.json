            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" is a conditional statement which can be written as V → M (V for Vampire awake and M for Mummy awake).\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake,\" which translates to ¬M.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer from these two statements that \"The vampire was not awake\" or V is false.\n\nTo do this, let's consider the truth table for a conditional statement (V → M):\n\n- If V is true and M is true, then V → M is true.\n- If V is true and M is false, then V → M is false.\n- If V is false, regardless of the value of M, V → M is true.\n\nGiven ¬M (the mummy was not awake), we can see that for V → M to be true, V must be false. This is because if V were true and M were false, then V → M would be false, contradicting our given information.\n\nTherefore, the only way for \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" to hold true while also having it not be the case that the mummy must have been awake is if the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
