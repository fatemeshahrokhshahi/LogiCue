            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" is a conditional statement which can be written as \\( \\text{Red Car} \\rightarrow \\text{Blue Truck} \\).\n\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue,\" which means we cannot infer that the truck was definitely blue. This can be represented as \\( \\neg (\\text{Blue Truck}) \\) or simply \\( \\text{Not Blue Truck} \\).\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The car was not red' from these statements, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If the car is red (\\( \\text{Red Car} \\)), then according to the first statement, the truck must be blue (\\( \\text{Blue Truck} \\)). However, this contradicts the second statement that says it’s not necessarily true that the truck is blue.\n  \n- Therefore, for the second statement to hold without contradiction, the car cannot be red. If the car were red and the truck had to be blue (as per the first statement), we would have a direct contradiction with the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
