            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the logic step by step. The first statement is a conditional one: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be represented as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Football} \\rightarrow \\text{Basketball for Jen} \\]\n\nThe second statement says that it is not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. In logical terms, this means:\n\n\\[ \\neg (\\text{Basketball for Jen}) \\]\n\nNow we need to determine if from these two statements, we can infer that \"Tom did not watch football.\" \n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is false only when \\( A \\) is true and \\( B \\) is false. In all other cases, the conditional statement is true.\n\nGiven:\n1. If Tom watched football (\\( \\text{Football} \\)), then Jen must have watched basketball (\\( \\text{Basketball for Jen} \\)).\n2. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball (\\( \\neg (\\text{Basketball for Jen}) \\)).\n\nFor the conditional statement to be true, it cannot be the case that Tom watched football and Jen did not watch basketball (since \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is false only when \\( A \\) is true and \\( B \\) is false). Therefore, if we know that Jen did not watch basketball (\\( \\neg (\\text{Basketball for Jen}) \\)), it must be the case that Tom did not watch football to avoid making the conditional statement false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
