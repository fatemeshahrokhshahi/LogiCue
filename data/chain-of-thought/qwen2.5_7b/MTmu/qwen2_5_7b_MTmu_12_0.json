            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, let's break down the given statements and analyze their logical implications.\n\n1. The first statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( J \\rightarrow L \\)\n   where \\( J \\) stands for \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( L \\) stands for \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg L \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if from these two statements, we can infer that \"Joe did not go to the park,\" or in logical terms, \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is false only when \\( A \\) is true and \\( B \\) is false. In all other cases, it's considered true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( J \\rightarrow L \\)\n- \\( \\neg L \\)\n\nFor the conditional statement to be true (\\( J \\rightarrow L \\)), if \\( J \\) were true (Joe went to the park), then \\( L \\) would have to be true (Lucy must have gone to the zoo). However, we know that \\( \\neg L \\) is true. Therefore, for the conditional statement to hold, \\( J \\) cannot be true; otherwise, it would contradict the given information.\n\nThus, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park (\\( \\neg J \\)).\n\nAnswer: yes",
