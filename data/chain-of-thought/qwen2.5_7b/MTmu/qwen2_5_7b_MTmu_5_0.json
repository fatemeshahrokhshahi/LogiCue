            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" is a conditional statement which can be written as \\( J \\rightarrow A \\), where \\( J \\) stands for \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) stands for \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second piece of information states that it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis, or in logical terms, \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is false only when the antecedent (the part before the arrow, \\( J \\)) is true and the consequent (the part after the arrow, \\( A \\)) is false. In all other cases, it's considered true.\n\nGiven that we know \\( \\neg A \\), which means Amy did not play tennis, let's see what this implies for Jeff:\n\n- If \\( J \\) were true (Jeff played basketball), then according to the conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\), \\( A \\) would also have to be true. But since \\( \\neg A \\) is given, it means that \\( J \\) cannot be true; otherwise, we'd have a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the statements provided, if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff could not have played basketball because that would violate the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
