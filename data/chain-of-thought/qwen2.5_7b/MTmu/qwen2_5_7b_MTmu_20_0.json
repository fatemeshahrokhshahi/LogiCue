            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, let's break down the given statements and analyze their implications step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be represented as a conditional statement in logic: A → B (where A stands for 'the apple was red' and B stands for 'the banana must have been yellow').\n\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow,\" which translates to ¬B in logical terms.\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer from these statements that \"The apple was not red\" (¬A).\n\n4. In logic, a conditional statement A → B means that whenever A is true, B must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when A is false.\n\n5. The second statement ¬B tells us that the banana did not have to be yellow. This could mean two things: either the banana was indeed yellow (B), or the condition for the banana being yellow (the apple being red) was not met (¬A).\n\n6. Since we don't know whether B is true or false, and since A → B only tells us what happens when A is true, it does not give us enough information to conclude that ¬A must be true.\n\nAnswer: no",
