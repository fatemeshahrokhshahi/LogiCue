The first statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\" This can be represented as:\n   - If D (the dog being inside), then C (the cat being outside).\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside,\" which means we cannot definitively say C is true.\n\n3. To infer whether the dog was or wasn't inside, let’s consider both possibilities:\n\n   - If D were true (the dog was inside), then according to the first statement, C would also be true (the cat being outside). However, this contradicts the second statement that it's not the case that C must be true.\n   \n   - Therefore, D cannot be true; if we assume D is false (the dog was not inside), there’s no contradiction with the given statements.\n\n4. Since assuming the dog was inside leads to a contradiction, and assuming the dog was not inside does not lead to any contradiction, we can infer that \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
