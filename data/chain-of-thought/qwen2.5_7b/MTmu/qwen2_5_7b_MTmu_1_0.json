            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" is a conditional statement which can be written as \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) stands for \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding,\" which means we cannot infer \\( S \\). This can be written as \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nTo determine if we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding (\\( \\neg M \\)), let's analyze the implications:\n\n- From \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must also be true.\n- Given \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not at the wedding), we can use this to deduce something about Mary. If Sue wasn't there and it's a necessary condition that Sue would have been there if Mary were there (\\( M \\rightarrow S \\)), then Mary could not have been there either, because having Mary there would imply Sue must also be there.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer \\( \\neg M \\) (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nAnswer: yes",
