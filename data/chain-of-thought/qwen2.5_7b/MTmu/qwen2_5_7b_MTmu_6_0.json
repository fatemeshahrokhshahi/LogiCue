The first statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This can be represented as:\n   - If P (Sue chose pizza), then Q (Bob must have chosen pasta).\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta,\" which means we know ¬Q (it is false that Bob must have chosen pasta). \n\n3. In logic, if a conditional statement (P → Q) is true and its consequent (Q) is false, then by modus tollens, the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\n4. Applying this to our statements:\n   - We know P → Q.\n   - We know ¬Q.\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that ¬P (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nAnswer: yes",
