            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, let's break down the given statements and analyze their logical implications.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional (if-then) proposition: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.\" This can be symbolically represented as:\n   - P → Q where P = \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q = \"Kate must have eaten the salad.\"\n\n2. The second statement negates part of the first statement: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad,\" which translates to ¬Q.\n\n3. In logic, if we know a conditional (P → Q) is true and we also know ¬Q (not-Q), then by the rules of logical implication, we can infer ¬P (not-P). This follows from the contrapositive rule: If P implies Q, then not-Q implies not-P.\n\n4. Applying this to our statements:\n   - We have P → Q as true.\n   - We know ¬Q is true.\n   - Therefore, by logical implication, we can conclude that ¬P must be true, meaning \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
