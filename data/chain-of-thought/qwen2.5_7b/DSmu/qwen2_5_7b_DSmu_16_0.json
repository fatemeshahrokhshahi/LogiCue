The first statement, \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk,\" is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement). This means that at least one of these two conditions must be true.\n2. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk,\" negates the second part of the first statement.\n\nGiven these two statements:\n- If we negate the possibility that the pen is on the desk (second statement), then according to the first statement, the only remaining option for the pen is that it must be in the bag. This follows from the principle of disjunctive syllogism: if A or B is true and not B is true, then A must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
