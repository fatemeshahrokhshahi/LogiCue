The first statement is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement): \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\" This means that at least one of these two scenarios must be true.\n2. The second statement negates one part of the disjunction: \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\" This directly contradicts the second option from the first statement.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce:\n- Since it cannot be the case that the cat is playing in the bedroom (as per the second statement), the only remaining possibility under the disjunction of the first statement is that \"the cat is napping on the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
