The first statement says \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of these conditions (Fido being inside or Fido being in the garden) must be true.\n2. The second statement says \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\" This negates the second part of the first statement.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use logical reasoning to determine if we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\n- Since it cannot be true that Fido must be in the garden (from the second statement), and since at least one of the conditions in the first statement must be true, the only remaining possibility is that \"Fido is inside.\"\nAnswer: yes",
