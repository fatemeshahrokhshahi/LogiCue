The first statement, \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge,\" presents us with two mutually exclusive possibilities for where the milk can be located.\n2. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" negates one of those possibilities.\n\nGiven these statements, we have:\n- A disjunction (either/or) between the milk being on the counter or in the fridge.\n- The denial of the option for it to be in the fridge.\n\nBy applying logical reasoning, if the milk cannot be chilling in the fridge, then by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is that \"the milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
