The first statement, \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet,\" presents us with two mutually exclusive possibilities for where the jacket can be located.\n2. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" negates one of those possibilities.\n\nGiven these statements, we know:\n- If the jacket is not hanging in the closet (as per the second statement), then according to the first statement, it must be draped over the chair. There are no other options available since the two conditions are mutually exclusive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
