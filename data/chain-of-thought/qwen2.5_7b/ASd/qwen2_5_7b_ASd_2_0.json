The original statement is in the form of an implication: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"we go to the concert\" and \\( Q \\) is \"we'll have a good time.\"\n2. We need to determine if we can infer another implication, specifically \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( R \\) is \"a bomb goes off.\"\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about what happens when an additional condition (in this case, a bomb going off) occurs alongside the initial condition. The truth of the original statement only guarantees that if we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time; it doesn't say anything about the outcome if a bomb goes off during the concert.\n\nTherefore, from the given information alone, we cannot logically infer the second implication because the presence of an additional event (a bomb going off) is not covered by the original statement. The occurrence of a bomb could potentially change the outcome in ways that are not specified or implied by the initial condition.\n\nAnswer: no",
