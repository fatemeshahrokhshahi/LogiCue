The original statement is \"If the dog is in the yard, then it is barking.\" This can be represented as:\n   - P → Q where P = \"the dog is in the yard\" and Q = \"it is barking.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer \"If the dog is in the yard and it is asleep, then it is barking.\"\n   - This statement can be represented as: (P ∧ R) → Q where P = \"the dog is in the yard,\" R = \"it is asleep,\" and Q = \"it is barking.\"\n\n3. The original statement only tells us that if the condition P is true, then Q must also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when the dog is both in the yard (P) and asleep (R).\n\n4. Since being asleep (R) could potentially contradict or have no relation to barking (Q), we cannot logically infer that if the dog is in the yard and it is asleep, then it must be barking.\n\nAnswer: no",
