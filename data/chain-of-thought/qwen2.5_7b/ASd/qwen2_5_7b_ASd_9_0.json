            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A\" establishes a conditional relationship where getting an A is contingent upon the essay being well-written. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the essay is turned in late or how that affects the grading.\n\nTo infer \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A,\" we would need additional information stating that turning in the essay late does not affect the grade as long as it is well-written. The original statement alone does not support this inference because it only addresses the condition of a well-written essay.\n\nAnswer: no",
