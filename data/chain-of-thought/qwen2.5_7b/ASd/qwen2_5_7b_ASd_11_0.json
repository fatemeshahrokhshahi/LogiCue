The original statement is a simple conditional: If P (getting enough sleep), then Q (you won't be tired).\n2. We need to determine if we can infer another conditional: If P and R (doing hard labor), then Q (you won't be tired).\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about the effect of doing hard labor on being tired, only that getting enough sleep prevents tiredness. Therefore, adding \"and do hard labor\" introduces a new condition without additional context or logical connection to the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
