However, this does not provide information about the effectiveness or safety of expired medications specifically.\n\nExpired medications may lose their efficacy and could potentially become harmful due to chemical changes that occur over time. Therefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that taking an expired medication will result in feeling better; it might even worsen one's condition or cause adverse effects.\n\nAnswer: no",
