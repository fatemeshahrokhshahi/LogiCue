The original statement is \"If I exercise, I will lose weight.\" This means that exercising alone (without any other factors) leads to weight loss.\n\nNow consider the second statement: \"If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight.\" For this to be true based on the first statement, we would need to assume that eating junk food does not negate or significantly impact the effect of exercising on weight loss. However, there is no information provided in the original statement about how eating junk food interacts with the effects of exercise.\n\nIn fact, it's generally known from nutritional science that consuming a diet high in junk food can counteract the benefits of exercise when it comes to weight loss. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one without additional information or assumptions.\n\nAnswer: no",
