            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" from the given statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" let's break down the logical structure.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form:\nP → Q (if P, then Q)\nWhere P = \"the doll was plastic\" and Q = \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer its contrapositive from this. The contrapositive of a conditional statement P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P (if not Q, then not P). In our case:\n¬Q → ¬P would translate to: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nThe key point in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
