The original statement is a conditional one: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt (L), then Mark bought the blue shirt (M).\" This can be written as L → M.\n2. We need to determine if we can infer from this that \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt (~M), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (~L),\" which is represented as ~M → ~L.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement (P → Q) is (~Q → ~P). The contrapositive of a statement always has the same truth value as the original statement. Therefore, if L → M is true, then its contrapositive ~M → ~L must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
