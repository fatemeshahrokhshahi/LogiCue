The contrapositive of a conditional statement P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P, which means \"If not Q, then not P.\" In our case:\n¬Q → ¬P\nWould translate to: \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nThe key point in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
