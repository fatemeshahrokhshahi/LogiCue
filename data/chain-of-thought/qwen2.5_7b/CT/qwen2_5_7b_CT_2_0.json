The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both parts and switching their order. So, for P → Q, the contrapositive would be:\n¬Q → ¬P (If not Q, then not P)\n\nIn our context:\n- ¬Q means \"the unicorn was not in the forest\"\n- ¬P means \"the griffin was not in the forest\"\n\nThus, the contrapositive of the original statement is: \n\"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nThe key point here is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, if we accept the truth of the original statement, we can also accept the truth of its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
