In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\" is indeed true based on the original statement.\n\nHowever, we need to infer the reverse of this contrapositive: \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). This would mean that if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. In logical terms, this is the inverse of the contrapositive and does not necessarily hold true just because the original statement is true.\n\nTo illustrate with an example: If \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet,\" we can say that if the ground is not wet, then it's not raining (contrapositive). But saying \"if it's not raining, then the ground is not wet\" does not necessarily follow from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
