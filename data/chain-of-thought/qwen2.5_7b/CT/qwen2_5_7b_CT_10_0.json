The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both parts and switching their order: \n- If not Q (the cat was not outside), then not P (the dog was not inside).\n\nThe contrapositive of any valid conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" we can indeed infer \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
