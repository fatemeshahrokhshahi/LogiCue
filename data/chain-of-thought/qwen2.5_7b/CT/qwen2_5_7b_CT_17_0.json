            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" from the given statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad,\" we need to understand the logical relationship between these two statements.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form:\n- If P (Ben ate pasta), then Q (Kate ate the salad).\n\nThis can be written as: P → Q\n\nTo find out if \"If not Q, then not P\" follows from this, we need to look at the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both parts and switching their order:\n- If not Q (Kate did not eat the salad), then not P (Ben did not eat pasta).\n\nThe key point here is that the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent; if one is true, the other must also be true. Therefore, from \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad,\" we can indeed infer \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
