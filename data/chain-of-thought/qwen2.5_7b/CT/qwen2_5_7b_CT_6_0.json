The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"P → Q,\" where P stands for \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q stands for \"Bob chose pasta.\" This means that if P (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then Q (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.\n2. To find out what can be inferred from this statement, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original conditional statement. The contrapositive of a statement \"P → Q\" is logically equivalent and has the form \"¬Q → ¬P,\" where ¬ denotes negation (not).\n3. Applying this to our statement: The contrapositive of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" would be \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n4. It's important to note that the original statement does not provide any information about what happens if Bob chooses pasta or if Sue does not choose pizza; it only states a relationship between these two events.\n\nAnswer: yes",
