In formal logic, a conditional and its contrapositive are logically equivalent; meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on logical equivalence, \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter (¬Q), then the alien did not visit Mars (¬P)\" can indeed be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
