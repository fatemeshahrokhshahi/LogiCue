            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" from the given statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"P → Q\", where P stands for \"Tom watched football\" and Q stands for \"Jen watched basketball.\" This means that whenever P is true (i.e., Tom watched football), Q must also be true (i.e., Jen watched basketball).\n\n2. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"P → Q\" is logically equivalent to the original statement, which is \"¬Q → ¬P\". In our case, this translates to \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\n3. It's important to note that the contrapositive always has the same truth value as the original conditional statement. Therefore, if we accept the original statement as true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
