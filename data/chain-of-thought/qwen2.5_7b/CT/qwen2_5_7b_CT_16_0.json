            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" from the given statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" let's break down the logical structure.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional one: \n- If P (the shirt was cotton), then Q (the pants were denim).\n\nIn logic, this can be written as:\nP → Q\n\nTo find out if we can infer \"If not Q, then not P\" from this, we need to look at the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both parts and switching their order. It has the same truth value as the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of P → Q would be:\n¬Q → ¬P\n\nThis means \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
