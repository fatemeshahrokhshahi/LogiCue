The contrapositive of a conditional statement P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P, which means \"If not Q, then not P.\" In our case:\n¬Q → ¬P\nWould translate to: \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nThe key point here is that in classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, if we accept the original statement as true, we can infer its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
