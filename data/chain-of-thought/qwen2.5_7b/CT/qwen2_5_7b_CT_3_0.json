The contrapositive of an implication (P → Q) is logically equivalent to it and has the form:\n¬Q → ¬P,\nwhich translates in our context as \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nThe contrapositive can be derived from the original statement without any additional assumptions. It's a fundamental rule of logic that an implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
