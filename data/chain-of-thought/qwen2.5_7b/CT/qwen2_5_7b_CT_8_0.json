            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, let's break down the given statement and analyze its logical structure.\n\nThe original statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\nVampire awake → Mummy awake\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer from this that \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake,\" which translates to:\n¬Mummy awake → ¬Vampire awake\n\nTo understand whether this inference is valid, let's consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (P → Q) is logically equivalent to it and can be formed by negating both parts and switching their order: ¬Q → ¬P.\n\nApplying this to our original statement:\n¬(Mummy awake) → ¬(Vampire awake)\n\nThis means that if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake. This is exactly what we need to infer from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
