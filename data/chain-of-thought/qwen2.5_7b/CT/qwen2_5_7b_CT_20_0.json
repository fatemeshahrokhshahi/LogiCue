            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" from the given statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" we need to understand the logical structure of conditional statements and their contrapositives.\n\nThe original statement is in the form of a conditional: \"P → Q\", where P stands for \"the apple was red\" and Q stands for \"the banana was yellow.\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"¬Q → ¬P,\" which means \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n\nIn logic, a statement is equivalent to its contrapositive. Therefore, if we know that \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" (P → Q) is true, then by logical equivalence, \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" (¬Q → ¬P) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
