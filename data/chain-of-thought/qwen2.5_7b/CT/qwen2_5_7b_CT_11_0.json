This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nThe contrapositive of our original statement would be:\n- If the muffins were not blueberry (not Q), then the cake was not chocolate (not P).\n\nSince we know the given statement is in a form where its contrapositive can be directly inferred as logically equivalent, we can indeed infer \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
