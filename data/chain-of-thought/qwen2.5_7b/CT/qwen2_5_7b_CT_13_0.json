            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" from the given statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" we need to understand the logical structure of conditional statements and their contrapositives.\n\nThe original statement is in the form of a conditional: \n- If P (the car was red), then Q (the truck was blue).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive can be derived by negating both parts and switching their order.\n\nSo, for our given statement:\n- Original: If the car was red (P), then the truck was blue (Q).\n- Contrapositive: If the truck was not blue (not Q), then the car was not red (not P).\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, we can indeed infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
