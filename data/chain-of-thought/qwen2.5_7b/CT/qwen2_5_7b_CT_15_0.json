            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, let's break down the given statement and analyze its logical structure. The original statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be represented as:\n\nP → Q\n\nWhere P stands for \"Sam took a plane\" and Q stands for \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane,\" which translates to the contrapositive form of the original statement. The contrapositive of an implication (P → Q) is logically equivalent to the original statement and is formed by negating both parts and switching their order:\n\n¬Q → ¬P\n\nIn our context:\n- ¬Q means \"Erin did not take a train\"\n- ¬P means \"Sam did not take a plane\"\n\nThe contrapositive of P → Q is always logically equivalent to the original implication. Therefore, if we know that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" (P → Q) is true, its contrapositive (\"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\") must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
