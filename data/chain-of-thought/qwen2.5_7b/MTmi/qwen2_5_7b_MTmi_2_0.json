            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" - This is a conditional statement where the presence of the griffin (G) implies the presence of the unicorn (U). It can be represented as: G → U.\n2. \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\" - This means that there's a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest, but it does not provide certainty about its absence.\n\nTo infer whether the griffin was not in the forest based on these statements:\n\n- From G → U and knowing that U might not be in the forest (¬U is possible), we cannot definitively conclude ¬G. The statement only tells us what happens if the griffin is present, but it does not provide information about what happens when the griffin is absent.\n- If the unicorn was indeed in the forest, then according to G → U, the griffin must have been there as well (but we don't know this for certain from the given information).\n- The statement \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\" does not give us enough certainty to conclude that the griffin was definitely not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
