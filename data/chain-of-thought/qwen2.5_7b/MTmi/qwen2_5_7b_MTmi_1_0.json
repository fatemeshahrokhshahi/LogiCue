            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" - This is a conditional statement where the presence of Mary (P) implies the presence of Sue (Q). It can be represented as P → Q.\n2. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" - This means that we cannot definitively say whether Sue was or wasn't at the wedding, but it does imply that there is a possibility she was not.\n\nTo infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from these statements, we need to see if this conclusion logically follows. \n\n- The first statement (P → Q) tells us that for Mary to be at the wedding, Sue must also be there.\n- However, the second statement only gives us a possibility about Sue's presence and does not provide enough information to definitively say she was or wasn't at the wedding.\n\nGiven these points, we cannot conclusively infer that 'Mary was not at the wedding' because:\n- If Sue might not have been at the wedding, it doesn't contradict the scenario where both Mary and Sue were at the wedding.\n- The statement about Sue does not provide enough information to negate the possibility of Mary being there.\n\nAnswer: no",
