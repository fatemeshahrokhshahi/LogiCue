            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\" is a conditional statement that can be written as \\( B \\rightarrow W \\), where \\( B \\) stands for \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) stands for \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The second statement says \"The wolf might not have been in the den,\" which means it is possible that \\( \\neg W \\).\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave\" (\\( \\neg B \\)), let's consider the implications:\n\n- If \\( B \\) were true, then according to the conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow W \\), \\( W \\) must also be true. However, since it is stated that the wolf might not have been in the den (i.e., \\( \\neg W \\) is a possibility), this means that if the bear was indeed in the cave (\\( B \\)), then we would contradict the given information about the wolf's location.\n\n- Therefore, for the statement \"The wolf might not have been in the den\" to hold true without contradiction, it must be the case that \\( B \\) is false. If \\( B \\) were true, then \\( W \\) would necessarily be true, which contradicts the possibility of \\( \\neg W \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
