            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" - This is a conditional statement where the antecedent (Tom watching football) implies the consequent (Jen watching basketball).\n\n2. \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" - This indicates that there's uncertainty about whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\nTo infer 'Tom did not watch football' from these statements, we need to see if the second statement contradicts the first one in a way that allows us to conclude Tom didn't watch football.\n\nThe key here is understanding what \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" means. It suggests there's a possibility Jen could or couldn't have watched basketball. However, it does not provide enough information to definitively state whether she did or did not watch basketball.\n\nGiven the conditional statement, if Tom had indeed watched football, then according to the condition, Jen must have watched basketball. But since we are told that \"Jen might not have watched basketball,\" this creates a scenario where the condition (Tom watching football) does not necessarily hold true because its consequent is uncertain.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty about Jen's activity doesn't directly imply Tom didn't watch football; it only suggests there isn't enough information to confirm he did. We cannot definitively infer that Tom did not watch football based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
