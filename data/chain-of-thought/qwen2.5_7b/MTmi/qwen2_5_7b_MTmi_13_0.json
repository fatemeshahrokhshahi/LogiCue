            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" - This is a conditional statement where the antecedent (the part before \"then\") is \"the car was red,\" and the consequent (the part after \"then\") is \"the truck must have been blue.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: Car = Red → Truck = Blue.\n\n2. \"The truck might not have been blue\" - This statement suggests that it's possible for the truck to not be blue, but it does not provide a definitive fact about the color of the truck. It means there is uncertainty regarding whether the truck is or isn't blue.\n\nTo infer if \"the car was not red,\" we need to consider both statements together:\n\n- If the car were indeed red (Car = Red), then according to the first statement, the truck must be blue (Truck = Blue). However, this contradicts the second statement that says \"The truck might not have been blue.\" This means it's impossible for the car to be red because if it were, the truck would definitively be blue, which is inconsistent with the possibility of the truck not being blue.\n\n- On the other hand, there could be a scenario where the car is not red (Car ≠ Red), and in this case, we cannot determine the color of the truck based on the given information. The second statement only tells us that it's possible for the truck to not be blue but doesn't provide enough information about its actual color.\n\nGiven these considerations, if the car were red, it would lead to a contradiction with the possibility stated in the second sentence. Therefore, we can infer that \"the car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
