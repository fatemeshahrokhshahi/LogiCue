            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" - This is a conditional statement where the antecedent (Lisa buying the red shirt) implies the consequent (Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\n2. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" - This means that it's possible for Mark to not buy the blue shirt, but we cannot definitively conclude this from the given information.\n\nTo infer whether Lisa did not buy the red shirt, let's consider what these statements imply:\n\n- If Lisa had indeed bought the red shirt (antecedent of the conditional statement is true), then according to the conditional statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt (consequent would be true).\n- However, we are told that \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt,\" which means it's possible for the consequent to be false. This directly contradicts what would happen if Lisa had bought the red shirt.\n\nGiven this contradiction, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt; otherwise, Mark would have definitely bought the blue shirt, which is not supported by the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
