            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\" - This is a conditional statement where playing basketball (B) for Jeff implies that playing tennis (T) for Amy follows necessarily.\n2. \"Amy might not have played tennis\" - This indicates uncertainty about whether Amy actually played tennis or not; it could be true or false.\n\nTo infer 'Jeff did not play basketball' from these statements, we need to see if the given information logically leads us to this conclusion.\n\n- If Jeff had indeed played basketball (B), then according to the first statement, Amy must have played tennis (T). However, since we are told that \"Amy might not have played tennis,\" it means there is a possibility that T is false.\n- The phrase 'might not' implies uncertainty but does not definitively state that T is false. It only suggests that playing tennis by Amy is not certain.\n\nGiven this setup:\n- If Jeff had played basketball, then Amy would definitely have to play tennis (from the first statement).\n- But since we are told \"Amy might not have played tennis,\" it creates a contradiction if we assume Jeff did play basketball because in that case, Amy should have played tennis according to the conditional.\n\nTherefore, for the second statement (\"Amy might not have played tennis\") to be true without creating a logical inconsistency with the first statement, Jeff cannot have played basketball. If Jeff had played basketball, then Amy would have to have played tennis, which contradicts \"Amy might not have played tennis.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
