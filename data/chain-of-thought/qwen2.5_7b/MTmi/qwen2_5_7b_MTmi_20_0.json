            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the logical statements given:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is a conditional statement that can be written as A → B, where A represents \"the apple was red\" and B represents \"the banana must have been yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement says \"The banana might not have been yellow,\" which means it's possible for B to be false.\n\nTo infer whether the apple was not red (¬A), we need to consider the logical implications:\n\n- If A → B is true, and B can be false (as stated in the second part of the problem), then A cannot necessarily be true. This is because if A were true, B would have to be true according to the conditional statement.\n\nHowever, this does not definitively prove that A must be false; it only means we cannot confirm A based on the given information. The possibility remains that the apple could still be red and the banana could be a different color (not necessarily yellow).\n\nAnswer: no",
