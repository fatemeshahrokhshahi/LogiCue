The first statement gives us two options: it is either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch. However, the second statement only tells us that there's a possibility (but not certainty) that it isn't under the couch.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to definitively rule out one of these possibilities, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
