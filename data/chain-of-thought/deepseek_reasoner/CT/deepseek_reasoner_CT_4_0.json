            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" can be represented logically as P → Q, where P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter\". The statement we are asked to infer is \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\", which is ¬Q → ¬P. In logic, this is known as the contrapositive of the original implication. The contrapositive ¬Q → ¬P is logically equivalent to P → Q, meaning that if the original implication is true, the contrapositive must also be true. This is because if Q is false (¬Q is true), then for P → Q to hold, P must be false (¬P must be true). Therefore, from the given statement, we can validly infer the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
