            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement that can be represented logically as A → C, where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race.\" The question asks whether we can infer \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race,\" which is logically equivalent to ¬C → ¬A. In propositional logic, an implication is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. The contrapositive of A → C is ¬C → ¬A, and this equivalence holds true regardless of the truth values of A and C. Therefore, if A → C is true, then ¬C → ¬A must also be true, meaning the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
