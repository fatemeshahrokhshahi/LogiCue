            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented logically as M → S, where M is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding,\" which is logically equivalent to ¬S → ¬M. In classical logic, an implication is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. The contrapositive of M → S is indeed ¬S → ¬M, and this equivalence holds because both statements have the same truth values in all scenarios. For example, if M → S is true, then whenever S is false (Sue was not at the wedding), M must also be false (Mary was not at the wedding) to avoid a contradiction. Thus, from the given implication, we can validly infer its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
