            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement in logic, which can be represented as P → Q, where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton,\" which is ¬Q → ¬P. This is known as the contrapositive of the original conditional. In logic, a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. This means that if P → Q is true, then ¬Q → ¬P must also be true. This equivalence holds because both statements have the same truth values in all scenarios: P → Q is false only when P is true and Q is false, and ¬Q → ¬P is false only when ¬Q is true and ¬P is false, which is the same as Q false and P true. Therefore, from the original statement, we can validly infer the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
