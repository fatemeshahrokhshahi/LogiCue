            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" can be represented logically as P → Q, where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" which is logically equivalent to ¬Q → ¬P. In propositional logic, the contrapositive ¬Q → ¬P is always logically equivalent to the original implication P → Q. This means that if P → Q is true, then ¬Q → ¬P must also be true. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
