In logic, the contrapositive of P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P, which is logically equivalent to the original conditional. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, from P → Q, we can validly infer that if Erin did not take a train (¬Q), then Sam did not take a plane (¬P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
