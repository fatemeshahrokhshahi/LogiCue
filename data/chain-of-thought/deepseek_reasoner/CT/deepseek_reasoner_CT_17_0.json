            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" can be represented logically as P → Q, where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate the salad.\" In propositional logic, the contrapositive of P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P, which is logically equivalent to the original conditional. This means that if P → Q is true, then ¬Q → ¬P must also be true. Therefore, from the truth of \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad,\" it follows that \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" can be inferred.\n\nAnswer: yes",
