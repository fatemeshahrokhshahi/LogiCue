The contrapositive of P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P, which translates to \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\". In propositional logic, an implication is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive, meaning that if P → Q is true, then ¬Q → ¬P must also be true. Therefore, the inference is valid based on this logical equivalence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
