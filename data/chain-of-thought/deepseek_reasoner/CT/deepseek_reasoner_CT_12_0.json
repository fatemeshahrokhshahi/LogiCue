            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" can be represented logically as P → Q, where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The question asks whether we can infer \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park,\" which is ¬Q → ¬P. In logic, this is known as the contrapositive of the original conditional. The contrapositive ¬Q → ¬P is logically equivalent to P → Q, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. This equivalence holds because both statements have the same truth values in all possible scenarios: when P is true and Q is true, both are true; when P is true and Q is false, both are false; and when P is false, both are true regardless of Q. Therefore, from the given conditional, we can validly infer the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
