            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" can be represented logically as G → U, where G is \"griffin was in the forest\" and U is \"unicorn was in the forest.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest,\" which is ¬U → ¬G. This is the contrapositive of the original implication. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if G → U is true, then ¬U → ¬G must also be true. This means the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
