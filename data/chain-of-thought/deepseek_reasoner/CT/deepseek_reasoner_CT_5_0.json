            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement in logic, which can be represented as P → Q, where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P, which translates to \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" Since the contrapositive is always true if the original conditional is true, we can validly infer the second statement from the first. This is a fundamental principle in logic, ensuring that the truth of the original implication guarantees the truth of its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
