            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is a conditional statement in logic, which can be represented as P → Q, where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\" The question asks whether we can infer \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside,\" which is equivalent to ¬Q → ¬P. This is known as the contrapositive of the original conditional. In propositional logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if P → Q is true, then ¬Q → ¬P must also be true. Therefore, from the given statement, we can validly infer the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
