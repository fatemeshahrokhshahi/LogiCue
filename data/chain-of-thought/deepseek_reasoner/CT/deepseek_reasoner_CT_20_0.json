            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" can be represented logically as P → Q, where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\". The inference in question, \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\", is the contrapositive form, which is ¬Q → ¬P. In classical logic, the contrapositive of an implication is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if P → Q is true, then ¬Q → ¬P must also be true. Therefore, based on this logical equivalence, we can validly infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
