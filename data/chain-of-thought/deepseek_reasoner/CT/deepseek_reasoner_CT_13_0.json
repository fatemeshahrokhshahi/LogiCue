            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" can be represented logically as P → Q, where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red,\" which is ¬Q → ¬P. In logic, this is known as the contrapositive of the original implication. The contrapositive ¬Q → ¬P is logically equivalent to P → Q, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. This equivalence holds because if Q is false (truck not blue), then for P → Q to be true, P must be false (car not red); otherwise, a true P would require a true Q, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, from the given statement, we can validly infer the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
