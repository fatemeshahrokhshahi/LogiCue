            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement of the form P → Q, where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The statement to be inferred is \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James,\" which is of the form ¬Q → ¬P. In logic, the contrapositive of an implication P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P, and it is logically equivalent to the original implication. This means that if P → Q is true, then ¬Q → ¬P must also be true. Therefore, based on this logical equivalence, we can validly infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
