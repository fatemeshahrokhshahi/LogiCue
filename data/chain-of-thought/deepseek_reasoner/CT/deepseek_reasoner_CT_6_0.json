            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" can be represented logically as P → Q, where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza,\" which is ¬Q → ¬P. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a conditional statement (P → Q) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (¬Q → ¬P). Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and we can validly infer it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
