            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" can be represented logically as a conditional statement: P → Q, where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\". The question asks whether we can infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\", which is logically equivalent to ¬Q → ¬P. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement (P → Q) is ¬Q → ¬P, and it is always logically equivalent to the original conditional. This means that if P → Q is true, then ¬Q → ¬P must also be true. Therefore, based on this logical equivalence, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
