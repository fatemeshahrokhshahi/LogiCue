            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" which can be represented logically as P → Q, where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den.\" The question asks whether we can infer \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave,\" which is logically equivalent to ¬Q → ¬P. In propositional logic, a conditional statement P → Q is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, ¬Q → ¬P. This means that if P → Q is true, then ¬Q → ¬P must also be true, as both share the same truth conditions. Therefore, based on this logical equivalence, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
