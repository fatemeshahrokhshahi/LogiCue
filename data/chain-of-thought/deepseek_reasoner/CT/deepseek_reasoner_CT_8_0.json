            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be represented logically as V → M, where V is \"vampire was awake\" and M is \"mummy was awake.\" The question asks if we can infer \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake,\" which is ¬M → ¬V. In logic, an implication is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. The contrapositive of V → M is indeed ¬M → ¬V, and this equivalence holds true because both statements have the same truth values in all scenarios. Therefore, from V → M, we can validly infer ¬M → ¬V.\n\nAnswer: yes",
