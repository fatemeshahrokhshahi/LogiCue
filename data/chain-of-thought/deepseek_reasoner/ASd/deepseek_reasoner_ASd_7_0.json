            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm\" is a conditional statement of the form P → Q, where P is \"the oven is on\" and Q is \"the kitchen is warm\". In classical propositional logic, if P → Q is true, then for any additional condition R (such as \"the pilot light is out\"), the statement (P ∧ R) → Q must also be true. This is because whenever P is true, Q is true based on the original implication, and adding R does not change the truth value of Q when P is true. Specifically, if P ∧ R is true, then P is true, and from P → Q, Q must be true. Therefore, the inference from P → Q to (P ∧ R) → Q is logically valid, regardless of the content of R.\n\nAnswer: yes",
