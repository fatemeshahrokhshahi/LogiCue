            "content": "Explanation: In classical logic, from a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", we can infer \"If P and R, then Q\" for any additional condition R. This is because the original implication means that whenever P is true, Q must be true, regardless of other factors. So, if \"I exercise\" (P) implies \"I will lose weight\" (Q), then even when \"I eat junk food\" (R) is added to the antecedent, the truth of P still guarantees Q. However, in practical terms, real-world factors like diet can affect weight loss, but based solely on the logical structure of the given statement, the inference holds.\n\nAnswer: yes",
