            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If I change the oil, the car will run smoothly,\" which can be represented logically as P → Q, where P is \"I change the oil\" and Q is \"the car will run smoothly.\" The question asks whether we can infer \"If I change the oil and the transmission is shot, the car will run smoothly,\" which is (P ∧ R) → Q, where R is \"the transmission is shot.\"\n\nIn propositional logic, if P → Q is true, then (P ∧ R) → Q must also be true for any R. This is because if P → Q holds, whenever P is true, Q is true. Now, consider (P ∧ R) → Q: if P ∧ R is true, then P is true, and since P → Q, Q must be true. Therefore, (P ∧ R) → Q is true. If P ∧ R is false, the implication (P ∧ R) → Q is vacuously true. Thus, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAlthough in everyday contexts, adding a condition like \"the transmission is shot\" might seem to challenge the conclusion (e.g., if the transmission is faulty, the car might not run smoothly even with an oil change), logical inference based on the given conditional does not depend on additional real-world factors. Since the original statement asserts that changing the oil alone ensures the car runs smoothly, it implies that no other conditions prevent Q from being true when P is true. Therefore, from a strict logical perspective, the inference holds.\n\nAnswer: yes",
