            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the car is in the garage, then it is safe\" is a conditional of the form P → Q, where P is \"the car is in the garage\" and Q is \"it is safe\". The proposed inference \"If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe\" is of the form (P ∧ R) → Q, where R is \"the garage is flooding\". In logic, (P → Q) does not necessarily imply ((P ∧ R) → Q) because the additional condition R might affect the truth of Q. For instance, if the garage is flooding, this could make the car unsafe even if it is in the garage, contradicting the conclusion that it is safe. Since the original statement does not provide any information about how flooding or other factors influence safety, we cannot infer the new statement from it alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
