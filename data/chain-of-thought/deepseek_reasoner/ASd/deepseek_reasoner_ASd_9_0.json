            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A\" is a conditional statement of the form P → Q, where P is \"the essay is well-written\" and Q is \"the student will get an A.\" The question asks whether we can infer \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A,\" which is of the form (P ∧ R) → Q, with R being \"turned in late.\"\n\nIn logic, from P → Q, we cannot generally infer (P ∧ R) → Q because the additional condition R might introduce factors that affect the truth of Q. For example, if the essay is well-written but turned in late, institutional policies (such as late penalties) could prevent the student from receiving an A, even if P is true. The original statement does not specify that timeliness or other factors are irrelevant; it only establishes a relationship between well-written essays and receiving an A. Therefore, strengthening the antecedent by adding R does not necessarily preserve the implication, and the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
