            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If I fertilize the lawn, it will be lush and green\" is a conditional statement that can be represented logically as P → Q, where P is \"I fertilize the lawn\" and Q is \"it will be lush and green.\" The question asks whether we can infer \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green,\" which is (P ∧ R) → Q, with R being \"there is a drought.\" In propositional logic, if P → Q is true, then for any additional condition R, (P ∧ R) → Q must also be true. This is because whenever P ∧ R is true, P is true, and since P → Q holds, Q must be true. Thus, the truth of P → Q ensures the truth of (P ∧ R) → Q, regardless of the specific content of R. While practical considerations like drought might affect the outcome in real-world scenarios, the logical inference itself is valid based on the structure of the statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
