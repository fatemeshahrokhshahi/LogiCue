            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today\" is a logical implication of the form P → Q, where P is \"the package has shipped\" and Q is \"it will arrive today.\" The question asks whether we can infer \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today,\" which is (P ∧ R) → Q, with R being \"it was misrouted.\" In propositional logic, if P → Q is true, then for any additional condition R, (P ∧ R) → Q must also be true. This is because if P ∧ R is true, then P is true, and from P → Q, Q must be true. Thus, the truth of P → Q ensures that whenever P holds (even when combined with R), Q holds, making the inference logically valid. While real-world scenarios might involve exceptions like misrouting affecting delivery, the logical inference based solely on the given implication holds.\n\nAnswer: yes",
