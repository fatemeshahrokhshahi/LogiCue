            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside,\" can be represented logically as P → Q, where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat must have been outside.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside,\" is the negation of Q, denoted as ¬Q. Using the logical rule of modus tollens, which states that from P → Q and ¬Q, we can validly infer ¬P, we conclude that \"the dog was not inside\" (¬P). This inference is sound because modus tollens is a fundamental valid argument form in logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
