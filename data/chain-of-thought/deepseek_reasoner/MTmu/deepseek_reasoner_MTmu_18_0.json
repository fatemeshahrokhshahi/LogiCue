            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal,\" is a conditional statement that can be logically represented as P → M, where P stands for \"the doll was plastic\" and M stands for \"the truck must have been metal.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal,\" is the negation of M, written as ¬M. In propositional logic, when we have P → M and ¬M, we can apply the modus tollens inference rule, which states that if P implies M and M is false, then P must be false. Therefore, from P → M and ¬M, we can validly infer ¬P, which means \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
