            "content": "Explanation: The first premise, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" can be represented logically as an implication: M → S, where M stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S stands for \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The use of \"must\" here emphasizes the conditional relationship but does not change the logical structure; it still functions as a material implication.\n\nThe second premise, \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding,\" denies the truth of S, meaning that Sue was not at the wedding, which can be written as ¬S.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (¬M) from these two premises. This is a classic example of modus tollens, a valid inference rule in logic. Modus tollens states that from P → Q and ¬Q, we can deduce ¬P. Here, P is M and Q is S, so from M → S and ¬S, we can validly infer ¬M.\n\nTherefore, the inference is logically sound.\n\nAnswer: yes",
