            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be represented in logical terms. Let \"J\" stand for \"Jeff played basketball\" and \"A\" stand for \"Amy played tennis\". The first statement, \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis,\" is a conditional implication, which translates to J → A. The second statement, \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis,\" is the negation of A, so it is ¬A. We are asked if we can infer \"Jeff did not play basketball,\" which is ¬J. This is a standard logical inference known as modus tollens: from J → A and ¬A, it follows logically that ¬J. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
