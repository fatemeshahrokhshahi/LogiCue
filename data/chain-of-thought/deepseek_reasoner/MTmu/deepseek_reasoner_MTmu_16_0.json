            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be represented in logical terms. Let P be \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q be \"the pants must have been denim.\" The first statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim,\" is a conditional: P → Q. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim,\" is the negation of Q: ¬Q. In logic, modus tollens is a valid inference rule that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false. Therefore, from P → Q and ¬Q, we can infer ¬P, which is \"the shirt was not cotton.\" This reasoning is sound and directly applicable here.\n\nAnswer: yes",
