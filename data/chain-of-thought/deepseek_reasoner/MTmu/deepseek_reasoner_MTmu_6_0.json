            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be represented logically. Let P stand for \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q stand for \"Bob must have chosen pasta\". The first statement, \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\", is logically equivalent to P → Q. The second statement, \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\", is ¬Q. Using modus tollens, a valid logical inference rule, if P → Q is true and ¬Q is true, then ¬P must be true. Therefore, from these premises, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
