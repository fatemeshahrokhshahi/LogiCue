            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" can be logically represented as an implication: P → Q, where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" is the negation of Q, or ¬Q. In logic, from P → Q and ¬Q, we can infer ¬P using the rule of modus tollens. Therefore, since ¬P corresponds to \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" this inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
