            "content": "Explanation: The given premises are: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\" and \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\" In logical terms, let P represent \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q represent \"the wolf must have been in the den.\" The first premise is P → Q, and the second premise is ¬Q. This matches the form of modus tollens, a valid logical inference rule, which states that from P → Q and ¬Q, we can conclude ¬P. Therefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave, which is ¬P. The use of \"must have been\" does not change the validity of this inference, as it is treated as part of the proposition Q in this context.\n\nAnswer: yes",
