            "content": "Explanation: The first premise, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race,\" can be logically represented as an implication: A → C, where A stands for \"Alex finished the race\" and C stands for \"Chris finished the race.\" The second premise, \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race,\" is the negation of C, written as ¬C. Using the logical rule of modus tollens, which states that from A → C and ¬C, we can validly infer ¬A, we conclude that Alex did not finish the race. This reasoning holds regardless of the word \"must\" in the phrasing, as it is treated here as emphasizing the factual consequence in the context of the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
