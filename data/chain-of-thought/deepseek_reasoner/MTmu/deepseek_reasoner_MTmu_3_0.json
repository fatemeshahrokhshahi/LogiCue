            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be represented logically. Let P stand for \"The book was written by James\" and Q stand for \"The book must be a mystery novel.\" The first statement, \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel,\" is logically equivalent to P → Q. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel,\" is equivalent to ¬Q. We are asked if we can infer \"The book was not written by James,\" which is ¬P.\n\nIn logic, this inference follows the rule of modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q (P → Q) and Q is false (¬Q), then P must be false (¬P). This is a valid deductive argument form. Given that P → Q is true and ¬Q is true, it necessarily follows that ¬P is true. Therefore, from the premises, we can logically infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
