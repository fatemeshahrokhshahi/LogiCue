            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be represented in logical terms. Let P stand for \"Tom watched football\" and Q stand for \"Jen must have watched basketball.\" The first statement, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball,\" is a conditional: P → Q. The second statement, \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball,\" is the negation of the consequent: ¬Q. In logic, from P → Q and ¬Q, we can infer ¬P using the valid inference rule known as modus tollens. Therefore, we can deduce that Tom did not watch football, which is ¬P.\n\nAnswer: yes",
