            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be represented logically. Let A stand for \"the alien visited Mars\" and B stand for \"the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" The first statement, \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter,\" is logically equivalent to A → B. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter,\" is ¬B. From A → B and ¬B, we can apply the logical rule of modus tollens, which states that if A implies B and B is false, then A must be false. Therefore, we can validly infer that the alien did not visit Mars, which is ¬A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
