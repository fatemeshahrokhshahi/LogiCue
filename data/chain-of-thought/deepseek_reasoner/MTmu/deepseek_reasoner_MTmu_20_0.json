            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be translated into logical propositions. Let P represent \"the apple was red\" and Q represent \"the banana must have been yellow.\" The first statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow,\" is logically equivalent to P → Q. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow,\" is the negation of Q, or ¬Q. In logic, from P → Q and ¬Q, we can infer ¬P using the rule of modus tollens, which is a valid form of inference. Therefore, based on this reasoning, we can conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
