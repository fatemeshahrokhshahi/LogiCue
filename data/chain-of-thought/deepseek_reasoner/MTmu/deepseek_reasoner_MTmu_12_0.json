            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" can be logically represented as a conditional statement: P → Q, where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (interpreting \"must have gone\" as asserting that Lucy did go, with \"must\" serving as emphasis rather than introducing modal logic for this context). The second statement, \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" is the negation of Q, so ¬Q. Using the valid inference rule of modus tollens, which states that from P → Q and ¬Q, we can deduce ¬P, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
