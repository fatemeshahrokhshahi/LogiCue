            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be represented in logical terms. Let P stand for \"Ben ate pasta\" and K stand for \"Kate must have eaten the salad.\" The first statement, \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad,\" is logically equivalent to P → K. The second statement, \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad,\" is ¬K. From P → K and ¬K, we can apply the logical rule of modus tollens, which states that if P implies K and K is false, then P must be false. Therefore, we can validly infer that Ben did not eat pasta, or ¬P.\n\nAnswer: yes",
