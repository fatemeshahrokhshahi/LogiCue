            "content": "Explanation: The inference can be analyzed using logical reasoning. The first premise, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest,\" can be formalized as a conditional statement: if G (the griffin was in the forest), then U (the unicorn was in the forest), where the \"must\" emphasizes the necessity or truth of U given G. The second premise, \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest,\" denies the necessity or truth of U, which is equivalent to ¬U. Using modus tollens, a valid logical rule, from G → U and ¬U, we can infer ¬G, meaning \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" Even if \"must\" is interpreted modally (e.g., G implies necessarily U, and not necessarily U), modus tollens still applies, leading to the same conclusion. Thus, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
