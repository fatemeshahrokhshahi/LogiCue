            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be translated into logical propositions. Let V represent \"the vampire was awake\" and M represent \"the mummy was awake.\" The first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake,\" is a conditional, which can be written as V → M. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake,\" is the negation of M, written as ¬M. In propositional logic, from V → M and ¬M, we can infer ¬V using the rule of modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false. Here, P is V and Q is M, so ¬V follows logically. Therefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
