            "content": "Explanation: The first premise, \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train,\" can be interpreted in modal logic as P → □Q, where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\" This means that if P is true, then Q is necessarily true. The second premise, \"Erin might not have taken a train,\" is equivalent to ◊¬Q, meaning that it is possible that Q is false. From P → □Q and ◊¬Q (which is equivalent to ¬□Q), if P were true, it would imply □Q, but this contradicts ◊¬Q. Therefore, P cannot be true, and we can infer ¬P, meaning \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
