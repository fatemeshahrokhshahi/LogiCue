            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" can be represented logically as M → S, meaning that if Mary was present, then Sue was necessarily present. The second statement, \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" indicates that it is possible that Sue was not present, which can be expressed as ◇¬S in modal logic, meaning that there exists a possible scenario where Sue was not at the wedding. However, from these premises, we cannot deductively infer that Mary was not at the wedding (¬M). This is because the possibility that Sue was not present (◇¬S) does not guarantee that Sue was actually absent in the real world; it only means that her absence is possible. If Mary was actually present (M true), then Sue must have been present (S true) based on the first statement, and this situation is consistent with the second statement as long as there is some possible scenario where Sue is absent. Therefore, the premises can be true even if Mary was actually at the wedding, so the inference to ¬M is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
