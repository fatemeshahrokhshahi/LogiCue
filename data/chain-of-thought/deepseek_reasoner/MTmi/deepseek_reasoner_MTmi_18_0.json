            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal,\" can be represented logically as P → M, where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and M is \"the truck was metal.\" The second statement, \"The truck might not have been metal,\" suggests that it is possible that ¬M (the truck was not metal), but it does not assert that ¬M is actually true. In logical terms, this means that M is not necessarily true, but we cannot use modus tollens directly because we lack the definite truth of ¬M.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" (¬P), consider a counterexample: suppose the doll was plastic (P true) and the truck was metal (M true). Then, P → M is true, and \"the truck might not have been metal\" could still be true if there was a possibility that the truck was not metal, even though it actually was. In this case, both premises hold, but ¬P is false. Therefore, the inference is invalid, as the premises do not logically guarantee the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
