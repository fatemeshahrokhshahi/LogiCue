            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel,\" can be interpreted in modal logic as P → □Q, where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" This means that if P is true, then Q is necessarily true. The second statement, \"The book might not be a mystery novel,\" is ◇¬Q, which is equivalent to ¬□Q. From P → □Q and ¬□Q, we can apply modus tollens to infer ¬P, meaning \"the book was not written by James.\" If the first statement were interpreted differently, such as □(P → Q), the inference might not hold, but given the use of \"must\" in the consequent, P → □Q is the more appropriate interpretation, allowing the inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
