            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" can be interpreted in modal logic as a conditional where the consequent involves necessity: if P (Lisa bought the red shirt), then necessarily Q (Mark bought the blue shirt), or P → □Q. The second statement, \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt,\" expresses possibility, meaning it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, or ◊¬Q. In modal logic, ◊¬Q is equivalent to ¬□Q. Given P → □Q and ¬□Q, we can apply modus tollens to infer ¬P, which means Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This reasoning holds because if P were true, □Q would be true, contradicting ◊¬Q (since □Q implies that ¬Q is impossible). Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
