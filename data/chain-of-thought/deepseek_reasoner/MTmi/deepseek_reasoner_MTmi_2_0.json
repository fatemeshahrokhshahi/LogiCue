            "content": "Explanation: The first premise, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest,\" can be interpreted in modal logic as G → □U, where G is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that if G is true, then U is necessarily true. The second premise, \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest,\" is ◇¬U, meaning it is possible that U is false. From G → □U and ◇¬U, we can derive a contradiction if G were true: if G is true, then □U must hold, but ◇¬U implies ¬□U, which contradicts □U. Therefore, G cannot be true, so we can infer ¬G, or \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
