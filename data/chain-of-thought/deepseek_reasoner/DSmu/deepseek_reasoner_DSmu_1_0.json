            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden,\" can be represented logically as a disjunction: A ∨ B, where A is \"Fido is inside\" and B is \"Fido must be in the garden.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" is the negation of B, written as ¬B. In propositional logic, from A ∨ B and ¬B, we can infer A through disjunctive syllogism, a valid form of reasoning. This means that if one of the options in a disjunction is false, the other must be true. Therefore, given these premises, we can logically conclude that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
