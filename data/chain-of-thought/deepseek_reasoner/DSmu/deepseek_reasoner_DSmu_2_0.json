            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table,\" can be represented logically as a disjunction: P ∨ Q, where P is \"the book is on the shelf\" and Q is \"the book must be resting on the table.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" is the negation of Q, so ¬Q. In classical logic, from P ∨ Q and ¬Q, we can infer P using disjunctive syllogism. This means that if one part of the disjunction is false, the other must be true. Therefore, since Q is false, P must be true, leading to the conclusion that \"the book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
