            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed,\" can be represented logically as a disjunction: P ∨ Q, where P is \"the missing sock is in the laundry basket\" and Q is \"the missing sock must be under the bed.\" The second statement, \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed,\" is the negation of Q, denoted as ¬Q. In propositional logic, the rule of disjunctive syllogism allows us to infer P from P ∨ Q and ¬Q. Since both premises are given and the inference is valid, we can conclude that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. The use of \"must\" in Q does not affect the logical structure here, as ¬Q directly contradicts Q, ensuring the disjunction resolves to P.\n\nAnswer: yes",
