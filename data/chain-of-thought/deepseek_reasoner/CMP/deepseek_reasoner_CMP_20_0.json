    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

            "content": "Explanation: The premises indicate that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers (P(C) is high), tea is less likely than coffee but more likely than soda, and soda is much less likely. Since coffee, tea, and soda are the only options, if coffee does not retain the most (¬C), then either tea or soda must retain the most. The probability that soda retains the most given that coffee does not is P(S | ¬C) = P(S) / [P(T) + P(S)]. Given that P(S) is much lower than P(T), P(S | ¬C) is low, meaning it is not likely that soda will retain the most if coffee does not. Instead, it is more likely that tea will retain the most in that scenario. Although the material implication ¬C → S has a high probability because P(C) is high (since ¬C → S is equivalent to C ∨ S, and P(C ∨ S) is high), the intuitive meaning of \"it's likely that if coffee doesn’t retain the most, soda will\" refers to the conditional probability P(S | ¬C), which is low based on the premises. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow.\n\nAnswer: no",
