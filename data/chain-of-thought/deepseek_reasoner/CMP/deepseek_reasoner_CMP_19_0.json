    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "Explanation: The argument involves three housing costs: rents (R), home prices (H), and mortgage rates (M), with only one expected to increase the most. The economists project that R is likely true (rents increase the most), which implies that H is unlikely (home prices won't increase the most). The given conditional statement, \"if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most,\" is logically equivalent to ¬H → (¬R → M). This can be rewritten as (¬H ∧ ¬R) → M, which is necessarily true because there are only three costs, so if neither H nor R is the most, M must be the most.\n\nThe question asks whether it is likely that ¬R → M (if rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most). Logically, ¬R → M is equivalent to R ∨ M, meaning it is true if either R is true or M is true. Since R is likely true (as projected), the probability of R ∨ M is high because P(R ∨ M) ≥ P(R). Therefore, ¬R → M is likely true, as the only scenario where it is false is when ¬R and ¬M are both true, which corresponds to H being true. However, H is unlikely because R is likely, so P(¬R ∧ ¬M) = P(H) is low. Thus, the probability that ¬R → M is true is high.\n\nAnswer: yes",
