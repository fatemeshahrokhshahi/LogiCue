    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The scenario involves India, China, and Russia as the top three emerging economies, with only one able to be the top-growing economy. The economists project that it is likely India's economy will grow the fastest, implying a high probability for India being top (P(I) is high). Consequently, China is unlikely to be top (P(C) is low). The conditional statement \"if China is not the top-growing, then if India isn’t, Russia will be\" is logically equivalent to ¬C → (¬I → R), which simplifies to ¬C → (I ∨ R). However, given that only one economy can be top, ¬I → R is equivalent to I ∨ R, and P(I ∨ R) = P(I) + P(R) since I and R are mutually exclusive. Although P(R) is low due to Russia's growth lagging distantly behind, P(I) is high, so P(I ∨ R) is high. Alternatively, P(¬I → R) = P(I ∨ R) = 1 - P(C), and since P(C) is low, P(¬I → R) is high. Therefore, it is likely that if India is not the top-growing economy, Russia will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
