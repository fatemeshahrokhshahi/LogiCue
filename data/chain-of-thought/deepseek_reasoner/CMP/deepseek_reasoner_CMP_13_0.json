    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The problem involves evaluating whether it is likely that Missouri will add the most jobs if Tennessee does not, based on the given information. The states Tennessee (T), Georgia (G), and Missouri (M) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive for adding the most jobs, as implied by the conditional statement \"if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will,\" which ensures that at least one of T, G, or M must be true. Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs (P(T) is high), Georgia is less likely but still significant (P(G) is less than P(T) but not negligible), and Missouri is much less likely (P(M) is low). The conditional probability P(M | ¬T) is given by P(M) / [P(G) + P(M)]. Since P(G) is not very small and P(M) is significantly lower, P(M | ¬T) could be low—for example, if P(T) = 0.7, P(G) = 0.2, P(M) = 0.1, then P(M | ¬T) ≈ 0.333, which is not high. The information that Tennessee is likely and hence Georgia is unlikely (P(¬G) is high) does not force P(M | ¬T) to be high, as Georgia remains the more likely alternative when Tennessee does not add the most jobs. Therefore, it does not follow that it is likely that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will.\n\nAnswer: no",
