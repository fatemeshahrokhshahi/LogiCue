    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The scenario involves three mutually exclusive events—minimum wage hike (MW), paid family leave (PL), and student loan forgiveness (LF)—with only one occurring. The conditional statement \"if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen\" (¬PL → (¬MW → LF)) is necessarily true under mutual exclusivity, as if neither PL nor MW occurs, LF must occur. Thus, this statement does not impose additional probabilistic constraints.\n\nThe probabilities are given as P(MW) > P(PL) > P(LF), with P(MW) high and P(LF) much lower than P(PL). The statement \"a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen\" implies that P(MW) is high, so P(PL) is low, but P(PL) is still greater than P(LF).\n\nThe question asks whether it follows that P(LF | ¬MW) is likely (i.e., probability greater than 0.5). P(LF | ¬MW) = P(LF) / [P(PL) + P(LF)]. Since P(PL) > P(LF), the ratio P(LF) / [P(PL) + P(LF)] is less than 0.5, meaning P(LF | ¬MW) is not likely. For example, if P(MW) = 0.7, P(PL) = 0.25, P(LF) = 0.05, then P(LF | ¬MW) ≈ 0.167, which is low. Therefore, it does not follow that P(LF | ¬MW) is likely.\n\nAnswer: no",
