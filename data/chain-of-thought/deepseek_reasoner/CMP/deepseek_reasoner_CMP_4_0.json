    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The hiring manager believes that Priya is most likely to get the offer, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. This implies that the probabilities satisfy P(P) > P(J) > P(D), and since only one candidate can be offered the position, P(P) + P(J) + P(D) = 1. The statement \"if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will\" is tautologically true given the mutual exclusivity and exhaustiveness of the events, so it doesn't add new probabilistic information.\n\nThe question is whether it is likely that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will, which corresponds to the conditional probability P(D | ¬P). Using probability theory, P(D | ¬P) = P(D) / [P(J) + P(D)]. Since P(J) > P(D), it follows that P(D) / [P(J) + P(D)] < 0.5. For example, if P(P) = 0.8, P(J) = 0.15, P(D) = 0.05, then P(D | ¬P) = 0.05 / (0.15 + 0.05) = 0.25, which is not high. Thus, even though Priya is likely to get the offer, it does not follow that Diego is likely to get it if Priya doesn't, because Julian is more likely than Diego in that scenario.\n\nAnswer: no",
