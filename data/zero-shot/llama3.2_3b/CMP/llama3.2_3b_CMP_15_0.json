    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?",
