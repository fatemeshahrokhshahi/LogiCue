In classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. If A → C is true, then ¬C → ¬A must also be true.\n\nThis is because:\n- If A → C is true, then whenever A is true, C must be true\n- Therefore, if C is false, A cannot be true (because if A were true, C would have to be true)\n- So if C is false, A must be false\n\nyes",
