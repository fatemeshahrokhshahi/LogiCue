This indicates necessity - if T is true, then J is necessarily true.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know it's possible that Jen didn't watch basketball (◇¬J).\n\nIf Tom watched football (T), then by premise 1, Jen must have watched basketball (J is necessary). But premise 2 tells us ¬J is possible. This creates a contradiction - J cannot be both necessary and possibly false.\n\nTherefore, Tom cannot have watched football.\n\n**yes**",
