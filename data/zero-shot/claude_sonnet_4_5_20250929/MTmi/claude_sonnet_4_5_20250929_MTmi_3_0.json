If we read it as:\n- \"If J, then necessarily M\" (J → □M)\n\nThen from ◊¬M (it's possible that not-M), we can derive ¬□M (it's not necessary that M).\n\nBy contraposition of J → □M, we get ¬□M → ¬J.\n\nTherefore: ¬J follows.\n\nThis interpretation treats the conditional as having a necessary consequent, making the inference valid.\n\n**yes**",
