This is incompatible with the cat *must* have been outside.\n\nIf the dog was inside (D is true), then by premise 1, the cat must have been outside (C must be true). But this contradicts premise 2, which says the cat might not have been outside.\n\nTherefore, the dog cannot have been inside.\n\n**yes**",
