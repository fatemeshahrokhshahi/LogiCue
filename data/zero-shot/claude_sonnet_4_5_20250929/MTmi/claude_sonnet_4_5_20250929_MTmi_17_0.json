If we're in a scenario where Kate actually didn't eat salad, then by modus tollens from statement 1, Ben didn't eat pasta.\n\nHowever, \"might not have\" only establishes possibility, not actuality. It means we cannot definitively conclude that Ben did not eat pasta - we can only conclude that Ben might not have eaten pasta.\n\nFor a strict logical inference (where the conclusion must be true whenever the premises are true), we would need \"Kate did not eat salad\" rather than \"Kate might not have eaten salad.\"\n\n**no**",
