It only tells us that it's possible the mummy wasn't awake.\n\nTo infer ¬V from V → M, we would need ¬M (the mummy was definitely not awake) via modus tollens.\n\nBut we only have ◊¬M (possibly not awake), not ¬M (definitely not awake).\n\nThe possibility that the mummy wasn't awake doesn't allow us to conclude definitively that the vampire wasn't awake.\n\nno",
