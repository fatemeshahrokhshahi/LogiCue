If we read it as a necessity operator (□), then premise 1 becomes: J → □L (if Joe went to the park, then necessarily Lucy went to the zoo).\n\nFrom J → □L, we can derive: ◇¬L → ¬J\n\nThis is because:\n- If it's possible that Lucy didn't go to the zoo (◇¬L)\n- Then it's not the case that Lucy necessarily went to the zoo (¬□L)\n- Therefore Joe didn't go to the park (¬J)\n\nSince we have ◇¬L as premise 2, we can indeed infer ¬J.\n\n**yes**",
