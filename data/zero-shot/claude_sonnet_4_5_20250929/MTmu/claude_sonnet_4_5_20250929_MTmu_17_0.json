It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad (¬Q)\n\nThis is a classic example of modus tollens, a valid form of logical inference:\n- If P then Q\n- Not Q\n- Therefore, not P\n\nSince Kate did not eat the salad (¬Q), and we know that Ben eating pasta would require Kate to have eaten the salad (P → Q), we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta (¬P).\n\n**yes**",
