It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\n\nIn logical form:\n1. J → A (where J = Jeff played basketball, A = Amy must have played tennis)\n2. ¬A (Amy did not must have played tennis)\n\nThis is a classic example of modus tollens, which states:\n- If P → Q\n- And ¬Q\n- Then ¬P\n\nApplying modus tollens:\n- From J → A and ¬A\n- We can conclude ¬J (Jeff did not play basketball)\n\nyes",
