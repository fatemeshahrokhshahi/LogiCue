It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\n\nLet me denote:\n- P = \"Fido is inside\"\n- Q = \"Fido must be in the garden\"\n\nThe premises are:\n1. P ∨ Q (P or Q)\n2. ¬Q (not Q)\n\nUsing disjunctive syllogism (a valid rule of inference):\n- From (P ∨ Q) and ¬Q, we can conclude P\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nyes",
