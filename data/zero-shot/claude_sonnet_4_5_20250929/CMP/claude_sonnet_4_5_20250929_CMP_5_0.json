    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

It's likely that D gains the most\n2. Therefore, it's likely that ¬R (R doesn't gain the most)\n\nThe question asks: Is it likely that (¬D → L)?\n\nNow, (¬D → L) is equivalent to (¬D ∧ ¬L) being false, or \"either D or L gains the most.\"\n\nGiven that we know ¬R is likely true, and we have the conditional (¬R ∧ ¬D) → L, we can derive:\nIf ¬R is true (which is likely), then ¬D → L follows from the given conditional.\n\nSince it's likely that ¬R (Republicans won't gain the most), and we have the conditional that applies when ¬R is true, it follows that it is likely that (¬D → L).\n\nYes",
