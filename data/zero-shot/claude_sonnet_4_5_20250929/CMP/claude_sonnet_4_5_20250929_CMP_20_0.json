    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers\n3. If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers\n4. Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers (repeated)\n5. Therefore, tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that \"if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers\"?\n\nFrom premise 2/4: Coffee likely retains the most → Tea likely doesn't retain the most\n\nFrom premise 3: If tea doesn't retain the most, then (if coffee doesn't retain the most → soda retains the most)\n\nSince it's likely that tea doesn't retain the most, and we have the conditional in premise 3, we can derive:\n- It's likely that (if coffee doesn't retain the most → soda retains the most)\n\nThis is exactly what the question asks about.\n\nYes",
