    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

Paid family leave is second most probable\n4. Loan forgiveness is much less likely\n5. If paid leave doesn't happen, then if minimum wage doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen\n6. Minimum wage hike likely will happen\n7. Therefore, paid leave likely won't happen (given only one law passes)\n\nQuestion: Does it follow that it's likely that, if minimum wage doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?\n\nLet me denote:\n- M = minimum wage hike happens\n- P = paid leave happens\n- L = loan forgiveness happens\n\nFrom fact 5: ¬P → (¬M → L)\n\nFrom fact 6: M is likely\nFrom fact 7: ¬P is likely (because M is likely and only one law passes)\n\nNow, the question asks: Is it likely that (¬M → L)?\n\nGiven that ¬P is likely (from the reasoning in the passage), and we have ¬P → (¬M → L), we can conclude that (¬M → L) is likely.\n\nThis is because if ¬P is likely true, and ¬P → (¬M → L) is given as true, then (¬M → L) is likely true.\n\nyes",
