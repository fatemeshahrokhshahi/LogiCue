    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?",

Uber likely will have the most rides, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer\n3. If Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides\n4. Uber likely will give the most rides, and hence Lyft likely won't give the most rides\n\nQuestion: Does it follow that it's likely that, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will?\n\nLet me work through this:\n\nFrom statement 3: ¬Lyft_most → (¬Uber_most → Taxis_most)\n\nThis is logically equivalent to: (¬Lyft_most ∧ ¬Uber_most) → Taxis_most\n\nFrom statement 4: It's likely that Uber gives the most rides, so it's likely that Lyft doesn't give the most rides.\n\nNow, the question asks: Is it likely that (¬Uber_most → Taxis_most)?\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that IF Lyft doesn't give the most rides, THEN (if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will).\n\nFrom statement 4, we know it's likely that Lyft doesn't give the most rides.\n\nSo it's likely that the antecedent of statement 3 holds, which means it's likely that: (¬Uber_most → Taxis_most).\n\nYes",
