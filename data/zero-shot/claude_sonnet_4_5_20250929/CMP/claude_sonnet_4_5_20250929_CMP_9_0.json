    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it’s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be. Moreover, it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.\n\nGiven information:\n1. Apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits\n2. It's likely apples will be top-selling, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly\n3. If bananas aren't top seller, then if apples aren't top seller, oranges will be\n4. It's likely apples will be top (and hence bananas won't be)\n\nQuestion: Does it follow that it's likely that \"if apples aren't top, then oranges will be\"?\n\nLet me work through this:\n\nFrom statement 3: ¬B → (¬A → O), which is equivalent to: ¬B → (A ∨ O)\n\nThe question asks whether: \"likely(¬A → O)\" follows.\n\nNow, we're told it's likely that apples will be top. This means in the likely scenario, A is true. But the conditional \"if apples aren't top, then oranges will be\" concerns what happens in the (unlikely) scenario where A is false.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know: If bananas aren't top, then (if apples aren't top, oranges will be).\n\nWe're told bananas likely won't be top (since apples likely will be). So it's likely that ¬B is true.\n\nIf ¬B is (likely) true, and we have ¬B → (¬A → O), then (¬A → O) should (likely) hold.\n\nSo yes, it follows that it's likely that if apples aren't top, oranges will be.\n\nyes",
