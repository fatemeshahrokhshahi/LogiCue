    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

Pizza is likely the top item (likely P)\n2. If burgers aren't top, then if pizza isn't top, tacos will be: ¬B → (¬P → T)\n3. Pizza likely will lead, hence burgers likely won't: likely P, therefore likely ¬B\n\nQuestion: Does it follow that: likely (¬P → T)?\n\nFrom premise 2: ¬B → (¬P → T)\nFrom premise 3: likely ¬B\n\nNow, if ¬B is likely true, and we have ¬B → (¬P → T), can we conclude that (¬P → T) is likely true?\n\nThe conditional ¬B → (¬P → T) tells us that in worlds where ¬B holds, (¬P → T) holds.\n\nIf ¬B is likely (true in most probable worlds), then in those most probable worlds, (¬P → T) holds.\n\nThis means (¬P → T) is true in the most probable worlds, which means it's likely that (¬P → T).\n\nTherefore: yes",
