    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it’s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

It's likely tidal power will generate the most electricity\n3. Solar is forecasted second, wind significantly behind\n4. If solar doesn't generate the most, then if tidal doesn't, wind will\n5. Tidal likely will generate the most, hence solar likely won't\n\nQuestion: Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal doesn't generate the most, wind will?\n\nLet me parse statement 4: \"If solar doesn't generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn't, wind power will.\"\nThis means: ¬Solar_most → (¬Tidal_most → Wind_most)\n\nFrom statement 5: It's likely that tidal generates the most, so it's likely solar doesn't generate the most.\n\nSo we have:\n- Likely(¬Solar_most)\n- From statement 4: ¬Solar_most → (¬Tidal_most → Wind_most)\n\nIf it's likely that ¬Solar_most, and we know that ¬Solar_most → (¬Tidal_most → Wind_most), then in the likely scenarios where ¬Solar_most holds, we have (¬Tidal_most → Wind_most).\n\nThis means: In likely scenarios, if tidal doesn't generate the most, wind will.\n\nTherefore: It's likely that (if tidal doesn't generate the most, wind will).\n\nyes",
