    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will?",

F is likely (flu likely will infect the most)\n2. If ¬C, then (if ¬F, then S) - which is: ¬C → (¬F → S)\n3. F is likely, hence ¬C is likely\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that \"likely(¬F → S)\" - i.e., is it likely that if flu doesn't infect the most, strep will?\n\nFrom premise 2: ¬C → (¬F → S)\n\nThis is a material conditional. If ¬C is true, then (¬F → S) must be true.\n\nFrom premise 3: ¬C is likely (it's likely colds won't infect the most)\n\nNow, if ¬C is likely true, and we know that ¬C → (¬F → S), then in the likely scenarios where ¬C holds, we must have (¬F → S).\n\nTherefore, it is likely that (¬F → S).\n\nYes, it follows that it's likely that if flu doesn't infect the most, strep will.\n\n**yes**",
