    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",

Forecasts show: likely spring > summer > winter (in terms of vacations)\n3. \"If summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will\" - This means: ¬Summer_most → (¬Spring_most → Winter_most)\n4. \"Spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't\" - This suggests: likely Spring_most, and likely ¬Summer_most\n\nQuestion: Does it follow that \"it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will\"?\nIn other words: likely(¬Spring_most → Winter_most)?\n\nLet me work through this:\n\nFrom statement 3: ¬Summer_most → (¬Spring_most → Winter_most)\nThis is equivalent to: ¬Summer_most → (¬Spring_most → Winter_most)\n\nFrom statement 4: It's likely that ¬Summer_most\n\nNow, if it's likely that ¬Summer_most, and we have the conditional ¬Summer_most → (¬Spring_most → Winter_most), then in the likely scenario where ¬Summer_most holds, we get: (¬Spring_most → Winter_most).\n\nTherefore, it's likely that (¬Spring_most → Winter_most).\n\nYes",
