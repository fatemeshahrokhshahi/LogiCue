    "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren’t the top seller, then if banana bread isn’t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn’t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",

It is very likely that B (banana bread will be top seller)\n2. If ¬C, then (if ¬B, then K) - equivalently: ¬C → (¬B → K)\n3. It is likely that B, and hence likely that ¬C\n\nQuestion: Does it follow that it is likely that (¬B → K)?\n\nThe key issue here is about the scope of the likelihood operator and conditional statements.\n\nFrom premise 2, we have as a factual claim: ¬C → (¬B → K)\nThis is logically equivalent to: (¬C ∧ ¬B) → K\n\nNow, the question asks whether \"likely(¬B → K)\" follows.\n\nThe conditional (¬B → K) is true in all cases except when ¬B is true and K is false.\n\nGiven that:\n- B is very likely (so ¬B is unlikely)\n- When ¬B occurs, we know from premise 2 that if ¬C also holds, then K must hold\n- We're told ¬C is likely\n\nSo in the unlikely event that ¬B occurs, ¬C is likely to hold as well, which means K would hold (by premise 2).\n\nHowever, the conditional (¬B → K) is automatically true whenever B is true (since the antecedent is false). Since B is very likely, the conditional (¬B → K) is very likely to be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, it does follow that it is likely that (¬B → K).\n\nyes",
