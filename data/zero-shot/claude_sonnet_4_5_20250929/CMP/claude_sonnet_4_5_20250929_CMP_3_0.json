    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn’t win, then if Spain doesn’t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won’t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn’t win, England will?",

While it's likely that Spain will win (and thus likely that Brazil won't win), this doesn't tell us what's likely *conditional on Spain not winning*. \n\nGiven that Spain doesn't win, we're left with Brazil and England. Since Brazil has much better odds than England overall, Brazil would still be more likely than England in this conditional scenario. Therefore, it's not likely that if Spain doesn't win, England will win - Brazil would be the more likely winner in that case.",
