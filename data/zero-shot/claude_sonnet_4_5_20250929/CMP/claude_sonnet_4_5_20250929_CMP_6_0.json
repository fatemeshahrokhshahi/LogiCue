    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny’s album doesn’t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift’s doesn’t, Beyonce’s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift’s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": "I need to analyze this step-by-step using conditional probability and logic.\n\nGiven information:\n- Three albums: Taylor Swift (T), Bad Bunny (B), and Beyonce (Y)\n- It's likely T will sell the most, followed closely by B, with Y far behind\n- If B doesn't sell the most, then if T doesn't sell the most, Y will (this means: ¬B → (¬T → Y))\n- T likely will sell the most, so B likely won't\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that (if T doesn't sell the most, Y will)?\nIn other words: Is P(Y | ¬T) high?\n\nLet me think about the logical constraint: ¬B → (¬T → Y)\nThis is equivalent to: ¬B → (T ∨ Y)\nOr: B ∨ T ∨ Y (at least one sells the most)\n\nSince exactly one must sell the most: T ∨ B ∨ Y, and they're mutually exclusive.\n\nThe constraint ¬B → (¬T → Y) means: if B doesn't win, then either T wins or Y wins.\nThis is actually just saying one of the three must win (which is already given).\n\nNow, we're told:\n- P(T) is high (likely)\n- P(B) is moderate but less than P(T)\n- P(Y) is low (far behind)\n\nGiven ¬T (T doesn't win), we need P(Y | ¬T).\n\nP(Y | ¬T) = P(Y) / P(¬T) = P(Y) / (P(B) + P(Y))\n\nSince we're told Y is \"far behind\" B, P(Y) << P(B).\n\nTherefore: P(Y | ¬T) = P(Y) / (P(B) + P(Y)) ≈ P(Y) / P(B), which is small.\n\nSo if T doesn't win, B is much more likely to win than Y.\n\nTherefore, it's NOT likely that if T doesn't sell the most, Y will.\n\nno",
