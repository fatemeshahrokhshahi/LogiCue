    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

Economists project: rents will likely increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less\n2. If home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most\n3. Rents likely will increase the most\n4. Hence, home prices likely won't increase the most\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that, if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?\n\nLet me denote:\n- R = rents increase the most\n- H = home prices increase the most\n- M = mortgage rates increase the most\n\nFrom the given:\n- Statement 2: ¬H → (¬R → M)\n- Statement 3: R is likely\n- Statement 4: ¬H is likely (follows from statement 3, since only one can increase the most)\n\nThe question asks: Is it likely that (¬R → M)?\n\nFrom statement 2: ¬H → (¬R → M)\n\nSince ¬H is likely (statement 4), and we have ¬H → (¬R → M), it follows that (¬R → M) is likely.\n\nThis is a straightforward application of modus ponens with likelihood: if ¬H is likely, and ¬H implies (¬R → M), then (¬R → M) is likely.\n\nyes",
