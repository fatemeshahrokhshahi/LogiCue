Adding an additional condition to the antecedent doesn't invalidate the conditional.\n\nHowever, there's a practical consideration: a dog being asleep and barking simultaneously seems contradictory in reality. But the question is about logical inference, not real-world possibility.\n\nLogically: If we know P guarantees Q, then P combined with anything else (including R) still guarantees Q, because P alone is sufficient for Q.\n\nyes",
