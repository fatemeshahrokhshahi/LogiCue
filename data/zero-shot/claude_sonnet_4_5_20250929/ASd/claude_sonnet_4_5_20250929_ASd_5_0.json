So \"the bill is paid and the check bounces\" describes a contradictory or impossible situation - you cannot have both the bill successfully paid AND the check bounce.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, the original statement tells us what happens when the bill IS paid. But if the check bounces, the bill is NOT paid, so we're outside the scope of the original conditional.\n\nTherefore, we cannot validly infer this.\n\nNo",
