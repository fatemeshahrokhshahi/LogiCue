If P alone is sufficient to guarantee Q, then P combined with any additional condition (like R) is also sufficient to guarantee Q. The additional conjunct in the antecedent doesn't prevent the consequent from following.\n\nFormally: From P → Q, we can derive (P ∧ R) → Q, because whenever (P ∧ R) is true, P is true, and therefore Q must be true.\n\nyes",
