But premise 2 only says it's possible that Q is false (◇¬Q), not that Q is definitely false (¬Q).\n\nFrom P ∨ Q and ◇¬Q, I cannot definitively conclude P.\n\nThe possibility that the jacket is not in the closet doesn't mean it definitely isn't there. So I cannot use disjunctive syllogism to conclude the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nno",
