It doesn't eliminate the option that the remote is under the couch - it only says this is possible.\n\nTo validly infer \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" using disjunctive syllogism, we would need:\n- Premise 1: (Coffee table) OR (Under couch)\n- Premise 2: NOT (Under couch)\n- Conclusion: Therefore, (Coffee table)\n\nBut we don't have \"NOT (Under couch)\" - we only have \"might not be (Under couch)\", which is weaker and doesn't allow us to eliminate that disjunct.\n\nTherefore, we cannot validly make this inference.\n\nno",
