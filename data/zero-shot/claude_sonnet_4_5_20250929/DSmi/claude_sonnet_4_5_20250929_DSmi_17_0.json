It means it's possible that the scarf is not on the coat rack, but it doesn't definitively establish that the scarf is NOT on the coat rack.\n\nTo infer \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\" with certainty, we would need to know definitively that the scarf is NOT on the coat rack. But we only know it might not be there.\n\nSince we cannot rule out that the scarf IS on the coat rack, we cannot conclusively infer that it must be in the backpack.\n\nNo",
