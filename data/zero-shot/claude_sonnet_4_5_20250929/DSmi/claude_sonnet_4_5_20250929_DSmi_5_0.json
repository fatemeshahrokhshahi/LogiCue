Then we could use disjunctive syllogism: from (J ∨ P) and ¬P, we get J.\n\nHowever, Premise 2 only tells us that it's possible the cookies aren't in the pantry, not that they definitely aren't. The cookies could still be in the pantry. Therefore, we cannot eliminate P as a possibility, and thus cannot conclude J with certainty.\n\nno",
