Statement 2 only tells us that ¬B is possible, not that ¬B is actually true.\n\nTo infer T from T ∨ B, we would need to know that ¬B is actually the case (not just possibly the case). Then we could use disjunctive syllogism.\n\nBut we only know that ¬B is possible, which is compatible with B being true in the actual world.\n\nno",
