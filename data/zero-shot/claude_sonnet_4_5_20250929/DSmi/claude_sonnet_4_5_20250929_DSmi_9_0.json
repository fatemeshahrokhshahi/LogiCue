This does NOT assert that it definitely is not blending on the floor.\n\nTo validly infer P from (P ∨ Q), we would need to know definitively that ¬Q (not Q). This would be disjunctive syllogism.\n\nHowever, \"might not be Q\" only tells us that ¬Q is possible, not that ¬Q is actually true. This is insufficient to apply disjunctive syllogism.\n\nTherefore, we cannot validly infer that the puzzle piece is definitely in the box.\n\nno",
