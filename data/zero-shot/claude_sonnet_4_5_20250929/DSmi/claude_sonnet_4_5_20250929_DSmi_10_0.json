This is expressing possibility, not certainty.\n\nFor a valid disjunctive syllogism (to conclude \"in the laundry basket\"), I would need to definitively eliminate one option - I would need \"The sock is NOT under the bed\" (a definite negation).\n\nHowever, \"might not be under the bed\" only tells us it's possible the sock isn't there, not that it definitely isn't there. This doesn't give us enough information to conclusively eliminate the \"under the bed\" option.\n\nTherefore, we cannot validly infer with certainty that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nno",
