It only means H could be false.\n\nTo infer B with certainty, I would need to know that H is definitely false (¬H). Then by disjunctive syllogism from B ∨ H and ¬H, I could conclude B.\n\nHowever, \"might not be H\" (◇¬H) is weaker than \"not H\" (¬H). The possibility that H is false doesn't guarantee that H is actually false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot validly infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nno",
