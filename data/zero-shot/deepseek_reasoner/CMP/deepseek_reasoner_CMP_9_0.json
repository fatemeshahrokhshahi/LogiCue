    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it’s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be. Moreover, it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",
