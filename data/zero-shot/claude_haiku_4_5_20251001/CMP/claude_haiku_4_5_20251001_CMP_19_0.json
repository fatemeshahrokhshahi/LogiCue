    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

However, the conditional statement \"if home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most\" becomes irrelevant once we know rents DO increase the most. When rents increase the most, the antecedent of the inner conditional (\"if rents don't increase the most\") is false, making that conditional vacuously true but telling us nothing about whether mortgage rates will increase the most if rents don't increase the most. The conclusion doesn't follow from the premises.",
