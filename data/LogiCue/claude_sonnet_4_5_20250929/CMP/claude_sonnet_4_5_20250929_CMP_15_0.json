    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

            "content": "Looking at this problem, I need to evaluate whether the nested conditional structure supports the conclusion.\n\nGiven:\n- P(stocks highest) > P(real estate highest) > P(bonds highest)\n- Stocks are likely to have highest returns\n- The nested conditional: \"if real estate doesn't have highest returns, then if stocks don't, bonds will\"\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that P(bonds highest | stocks not highest) is likely (>0.5)?\n\nWhen stocks don't have the highest returns, we're left with real estate and bonds. Given that P(real estate highest) > P(bonds highest) initially, and bonds have \"significantly lower expected returns,\" real estate remains more probable than bonds even after conditioning on stocks not being highest.\n\nThe nested conditional structure doesn't change this fundamental probability relationship. For bonds to be likely given stocks aren't highest, we would need P(bonds highest | stocks not highest) > 0.5, which would require bonds to be more probable than real estate in that conditional space. But this contradicts the premise that bonds have much lower odds than real estate.\n\nThe nested conditional tells us bonds will be highest IF both stocks AND real estate aren't highest, but this doesn't make bonds likely when only stocks are eliminated.\n\nno",
