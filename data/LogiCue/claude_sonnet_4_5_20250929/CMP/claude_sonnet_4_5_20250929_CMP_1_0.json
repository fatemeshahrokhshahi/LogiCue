    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don’t win, then if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won’t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

Therefore: \"If Lakers don't win, Celtics will win\" is likely\n\nBut let's check: P(Celtics | not Lakers) = P(Celtics) / [P(Warriors) + P(Celtics)]\n\nSince P(Warriors) is close to P(Lakers) and much higher than P(Celtics), when we condition on Lakers not winning, Warriors becomes the most likely winner, not Celtics.\n\nFor example, if P(Lakers) = 0.45, P(Warriors) = 0.40, P(Celtics) = 0.15:\nP(Celtics | not Lakers) = 0.15 / (0.40 + 0.15) = 0.15 / 0.55 ≈ 0.27\n\nThis is not likely (less than 0.5).\n\nThe nested conditional structure doesn't make the conclusion likely because Warriors still has higher probability than Celtics even when Lakers is eliminated.\n\nno",
