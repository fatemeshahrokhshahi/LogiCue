    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

            "content": "Looking at this problem, I need to evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. Coffee > Tea > Soda (in probability of retaining most drinkers)\n2. If tea doesn't retain most, then if coffee doesn't retain most, soda will retain most\n3. Coffee likely will retain most\n4. Therefore, tea likely won't retain most\n\nThe question asks: Does it follow that if coffee doesn't retain most, soda likely will?\n\nFrom premise 2, we know: ¬Tea → (¬Coffee → Soda)\n\nThis is logically equivalent to: (¬Tea ∧ ¬Coffee) → Soda\n\nSince these are the only three options, exactly one must retain the most drinkers. So if both coffee and tea don't retain most, then soda MUST retain most (with certainty, not just likelihood).\n\nThe question is about the conditional probability: P(Soda | ¬Coffee)\n\nGiven that coffee doesn't retain most, either tea or soda must. Since we're told tea is more popular than soda in mornings, P(Tea | ¬Coffee) > P(Soda | ¬Coffee).\n\nHowever, premise 2 establishes a logical constraint that guarantees: whenever coffee doesn't retain most AND tea doesn't retain most, soda will. Combined with premise 4 (tea likely won't retain most), this means in the scenario where coffee doesn't retain most, we're already in a situation where tea likely doesn't either, making soda the necessary outcome.\n\n**no**",
