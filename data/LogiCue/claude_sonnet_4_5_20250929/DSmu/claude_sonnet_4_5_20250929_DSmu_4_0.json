    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\"\n\nThe first premise creates a disjunction between:\n- A: The cat is napping on the couch\n- B: It must be the case that the cat is playing in the bedroom (a necessity claim)\n\nThe second premise negates the necessity: \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\"\n\nThis means: The cat need not be playing in the bedroom.\n\nHowever, negating \"must be playing\" (the necessity) does NOT mean the cat isn't playing in the bedroom - it just means it's not necessarily playing there. The cat could still be playing in the bedroom; it's just not required to be.\n\nSo we have:\n- Either A or (necessarily B)\n- Not (necessarily B)\n\nFrom this we can conclude A, because:\n- The disjunction requires at least one disjunct to be true\n- The second disjunct (necessarily B) is false\n- Therefore, the first disjunct (A) must be true\n\nThis is valid disjunctive syllogism applied to the modal claim itself.\n\nAnswer: yes",
