    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Looking at this argument, I need to carefully distinguish between content and modal claims.\n\nPremise 1: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n- A: The remote control is on the coffee table\n- B: It must be the case that the remote control is hiding under the couch (a necessity claim)\n\nPremise 2: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\"\n\nThis negates only the necessity of the remote control hiding under the couch. It tells us that it's not necessary that the remote control is under the couch - but this doesn't mean the remote control isn't actually under the couch. It could still be under the couch; it just doesn't have to be.\n\nSo we have:\n- A ∨ □B (Either A or necessarily B)\n- ¬□B (Not necessarily B)\n\nFrom these premises, we can validly conclude A by disjunctive syllogism.\n\nHowever, the key issue is whether ¬□B (it's not necessary that B) is equivalent to the premise we actually have. The premise states it's not the case that the remote must be under the couch, which directly corresponds to ¬□B.\n\nGiven this structure, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
