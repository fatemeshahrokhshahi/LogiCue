    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nThe first premise is: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n- A: \"The keys are in the drawer\" (a simple factual claim)\n- B: \"The keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" (a modal necessity claim)\n\nThe second premise is: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\"\n\nThis negates the necessity claim - it tells us that it's not necessary that the keys are dangling in the cabinet. However, this doesn't tell us that the keys are NOT in the cabinet; it only tells us they don't have to be there.\n\nNow, applying disjunctive syllogism:\n- We have: A ∨ Must(B)\n- We have: ¬Must(B)\n- Therefore: A\n\nIn this case, we ARE negating the exact modal claim made in the disjunction. The first premise says \"they MUST be dangling in the cabinet\" and the second premise denies precisely this - that they MUST be dangling there.\n\nSince we have a disjunction and we've negated one of the disjuncts (the modal necessity claim), we can validly infer the other disjunct.\n\nAnswer: yes",
