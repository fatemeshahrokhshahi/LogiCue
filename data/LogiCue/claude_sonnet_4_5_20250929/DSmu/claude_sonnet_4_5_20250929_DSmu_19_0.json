    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\"\n\nThe first premise creates a disjunction between:\n- A: \"The watch is charging on the dresser\"\n- B: \"It must be the case that the watch is on his wrist\" (a necessity claim)\n\nThe second premise negates the necessity: \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\"\n\nThis means: The watch need not be on his wrist (it's not necessary that it's there).\n\nHowever, this negation of necessity does NOT mean the watch isn't on his wrist - it could still be on his wrist, just not necessarily so.\n\nSo we have:\n- Either A or □B (where □ represents necessity)\n- ¬□B (not necessarily B)\n\nFrom \"Either A or □B\" and \"¬□B\", we can validly conclude A.\n\nThis is because:\n- The disjunction requires at least one disjunct to be true\n- The second disjunct (□B) is false\n- Therefore, the first disjunct (A) must be true\n\nThis is standard disjunctive syllogism applied to the modal claim itself.\n\nAnswer: yes",
