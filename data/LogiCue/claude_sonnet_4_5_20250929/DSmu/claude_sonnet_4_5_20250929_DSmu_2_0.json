    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

Here's why:\n- ¬□B only tells us the book need not be on the table\n- But the book could still actually be on the table (without it being necessary)\n- So we could have: the book is NOT on the shelf, and the book IS on the table (but not necessarily)\n- This would make premise 1 false (since A is false and □B is false)\n- But wait - if □B is false, then for premise 1 to be true, A must be true\n\nActually, reconsidering: If the disjunction A ∨ □B is true, and □B is false, then A must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nAnswer: yes",
