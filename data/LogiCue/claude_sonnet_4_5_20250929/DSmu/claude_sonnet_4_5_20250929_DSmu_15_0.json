    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the modal logic principles.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door\"\n\nBreaking down premise 1:\n- This is a disjunction: A ∨ □B\n- A = \"the shoes are in the closet\"\n- □B = \"the shoes must be lined up by the door\" (necessity claim)\n\nBreaking down premise 2:\n- This negates the necessity: ¬□B\n- This means \"it's not necessary that the shoes are lined up by the door\"\n- But this does NOT mean the shoes aren't lined up by the door - they could still be there, just not necessarily\n\nApplying disjunctive syllogism:\n- From A ∨ □B and ¬□B, we can validly conclude A\n- We have: (shoes in closet) ∨ (must be by door)\n- We know: ¬(must be by door)\n- Therefore: shoes in closet\n\nWait - let me reconsider. The key insight from the instructions is that negating \"must be true\" only negates the necessity, not the fact itself. However, in a disjunction A ∨ □B, if we know ¬□B, we can still apply disjunctive syllogism because we're eliminating that disjunct (the necessity claim), leaving A.\n\nThe shoes could still be by the door (without necessity), but the disjunction forces us to conclude A when □B is eliminated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
