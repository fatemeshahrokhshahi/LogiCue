    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\"\n\nLet me denote:\n- A = \"The toy is in the toy box\"\n- B = \"The toy is sitting on the bookshelf\"\n- □B = \"It must be that the toy is sitting on the bookshelf\"\n\nThe first premise is: A ∨ □B\nThe second premise is: ¬□B\n\nFrom these premises, using disjunctive syllogism:\n- A ∨ □B (premise 1)\n- ¬□B (premise 2)\n- Therefore: A\n\nThis is a valid inference. The second premise eliminates the second disjunct of the first premise, leaving us with the first disjunct.\n\nThe key point is that premise 2 negates the modal claim \"must be sitting on the bookshelf\" - it says this necessity doesn't hold. Since the disjunction in premise 1 requires either A or this necessity to be true, and we know the necessity is false, A must be true.\n\nThis is different from the case where we would have \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" being compatible with the toy actually sitting on the bookshelf (just not necessarily). Here, the logical form allows us to validly conclude A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
