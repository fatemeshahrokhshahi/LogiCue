    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

Since we've only eliminated the necessity of B, not B itself, we cannot validly conclude A.\n\nThe scarf could still be draped on the coat rack (just not necessarily so), which would make premise 1 false if we tried to use disjunctive syllogism here.\n\nThis matches the pattern described in the instructions: we cannot validly infer the first disjunct just because the second disjunct need not be true.\n\nAnswer: no",
