    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nThe first statement is: \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n- A: \"The phone is in the living room\"\n- B: \"It must be ringing in the kitchen\" (a modal necessity claim)\n\nThe second statement is: \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen\"\n\nThis negates the necessity claim - it tells us that it's not necessary that the phone is ringing in the kitchen. However, this doesn't tell us that the phone is NOT ringing in the kitchen; it only tells us that it's not necessarily ringing there.\n\nFor a valid disjunctive syllogism (Either A or B; Not B; Therefore A), we need to eliminate one disjunct entirely. But here:\n- We have: Either A or (must B)\n- We know: Not (must B)\n- This doesn't eliminate the possibility that B is true (just not necessarily true)\n\nSince \"must B\" is negated but B itself could still be true, we haven't actually eliminated the second disjunct in a way that would force the first disjunct to be true.\n\nThe phone could still be ringing in the kitchen (just not necessarily so), which would make the disjunction true without requiring the phone to be in the living room.\n\nAnswer: no",
