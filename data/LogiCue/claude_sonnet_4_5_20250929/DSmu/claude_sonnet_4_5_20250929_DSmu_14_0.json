    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully.\n\nThe first premise is: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n- A: \"The milk is on the counter\"\n- B: \"It must be that the milk is chilling in the fridge\" (a necessity claim)\n\nThe second premise is: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\"\n\nThis negates the necessity claim (B). It tells us that it's not necessary that the milk is chilling in the fridge.\n\nNow, we have:\n- Either A or B\n- Not B\n\nBy disjunctive syllogism, if we have \"Either A or B\" and \"Not B\", we can validly infer A.\n\nThe key point is that the second premise directly negates the modal claim made in the disjunction. The first premise says \"it must be chilling in the fridge\" (necessity), and the second premise says \"it's not the case that it must be chilling in the fridge\" (negation of that necessity).\n\nSince the second premise negates exactly what appears as the second disjunct in the first premise, we can apply disjunctive syllogism to conclude that the first disjunct must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
