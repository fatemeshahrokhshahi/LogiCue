    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch\"\n\nLet me denote:\n- A = \"The newspaper is in the driveway\"\n- B = \"The newspaper is sitting on the porch\"\n- □B = \"It must be that the newspaper is sitting on the porch\"\n\nThe first premise is: A ∨ □B (Either A or necessarily B)\nThe second premise is: ¬□B (It's not necessary that B)\n\nFrom these premises, can we conclude A?\n\nUsing disjunctive syllogism: If we have (A ∨ □B) and ¬□B, then we can validly infer A.\n\nThe key point is that the second premise negates the exact modal claim (□B) that appears in the disjunction. We're told \"either A or □B\" and then told \"not □B\", which leaves us with A.\n\nThis is different from the warning case where we might have \"A ∨ □B\" and \"¬□B\" but mistakenly think that \"¬□B\" is the same as \"B could be false.\" Here, we're directly negating the necessity claim that appears in the disjunction.\n\nSince the second premise directly negates the second disjunct of the first premise, disjunctive syllogism applies validly.\n\nAnswer: yes",
