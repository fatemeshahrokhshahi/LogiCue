    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nThe first premise is: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n- A: \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket\"\n- B: \"It must be that the missing sock is under the bed\" (a necessity claim)\n\nThe second premise is: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\"\n\nThis negates the necessity of the sock being under the bed. It tells us that B (the necessity claim) is false.\n\nNow, we have:\n- Either A or B\n- Not B\n\nBy disjunctive syllogism, if we have \"Either A or B\" and \"Not B\", we can validly infer A.\n\nSince the second premise directly negates the modal claim (the necessity) that appears in the disjunction, we can eliminate that disjunct and conclude that the first disjunct must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
