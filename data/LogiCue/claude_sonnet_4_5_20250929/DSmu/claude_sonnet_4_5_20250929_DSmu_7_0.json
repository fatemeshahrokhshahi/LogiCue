    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet\"\n\nLet me denote:\n- A = \"The umbrella is in the car\"\n- B = \"The umbrella is tucked away in the closet\"\n- □B = \"It must be that the umbrella is tucked away in the closet\"\n\nThe first premise is: A ∨ □B\nThe second premise is: ¬□B\n\nFrom these premises, using disjunctive syllogism:\n- A ∨ □B (premise 1)\n- ¬□B (premise 2)\n- Therefore: A\n\nThis appears to be a valid inference. The second premise eliminates the second disjunct (the necessity claim), leaving us with the first disjunct.\n\nThe key difference from the warning in the context is that here we're given \"It's not the case that the umbrella MUST be tucked away\" (¬□B), which directly negates the modal claim in the disjunction. We're not given \"The umbrella need not be tucked away\" which would be ¬□B but wouldn't tell us about B itself.\n\nSince ¬□B directly contradicts □B, and we have A ∨ □B, we can validly conclude A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
