    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nThe first premise is: \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\"\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n- A: \"The pen is in my bag\"\n- B: \"It must be the case that the pen is on my desk\" (a modal necessity claim)\n\nThe second premise is: \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\"\nThis negates the necessity claim - it says the pen need not be on my desk.\n\nNow, applying the reasoning from the instructions:\n\nWhen we have \"Either A or B must be true\" and \"B need not be true,\" we cannot conclude A. The negation of \"must be on my desk\" only tells us the pen doesn't have to be on my desk - but it could still be on my desk (just not necessarily).\n\nSo from:\n1. \"Either the pen is in my bag OR the pen must be on my desk\"\n2. \"The pen need not be on my desk\"\n\nWe cannot validly infer \"The pen is in my bag\" because the second premise only negates the necessity, not the possibility that the pen is on the desk.\n\nAnswer: no",
