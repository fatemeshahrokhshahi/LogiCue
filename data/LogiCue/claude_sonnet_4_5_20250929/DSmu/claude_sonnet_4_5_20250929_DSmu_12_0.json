    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\"\n\nBreaking down premise 1:\n- This is a disjunction: A ∨ □B\n- A = \"The jacket is draped over the chair\"\n- □B = \"It must be that the jacket is hanging in the closet\" (necessity claim)\n\nBreaking down premise 2:\n- This negates the necessity: ¬□B\n- This means \"It's not necessary that the jacket is hanging in the closet\"\n- This does NOT mean the jacket isn't hanging in the closet - just that it's not necessarily hanging there\n\nApplying the reasoning:\nFrom A ∨ □B and ¬□B, we can validly infer A by disjunctive syllogism.\n\nIf we have \"Either A or necessarily-B\" and we know \"not necessarily-B\", then A must be true.\n\nThe key difference from the warning: Here we're negating the entire modal claim (□B), not just saying B could be false. The disjunction is between A and the necessity of B, and we're told that necessity doesn't hold.\n\nTherefore, we CAN validly infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
