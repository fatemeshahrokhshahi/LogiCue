    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nThe first premise is: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n- A: \"The sunglasses are in her bag\"\n- B: \"The sunglasses must be perched on her head\" (a necessity claim)\n\nThe second premise is: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\"\n\nThis negates the necessity claim - it says the sunglasses need not be perched on her head.\n\nNow, applying the reasoning from the examples:\n\nWe have: A ∨ □B (where □B means \"must be B\")\nAnd: ¬□B (it's not necessary that B)\n\nFrom disjunctive syllogism, if we have (A ∨ □B) and ¬□B, we can validly conclude A.\n\nThis is different from the warning case because here we're actually negating the modal claim itself (□B), not just the content (B). The second premise directly contradicts one disjunct of the first premise.\n\nSince one disjunct (□B) is eliminated by the second premise, and we have a disjunction, the other disjunct (A) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
