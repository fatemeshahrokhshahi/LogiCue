Fertilizer alone cannot make a lawn lush and green without water. In fact, during a drought:\n- The lawn lacks the water needed for growth\n- Fertilizer cannot compensate for lack of water\n- The lawn would likely remain brown and dormant regardless of fertilization\n\n**Evaluation:**\nAdding \"there is a drought\" to the antecedent introduces a condition that undermines the causal mechanism by which fertilizing produces a lush, green lawn. The drought defeats the normal conditions implicit in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the lawn will be lush and green if we fertilize during a drought.\n\nThis is a clear case where strengthening the antecedent with a condition that contradicts implicit background assumptions makes the inference invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
