This is a typical ceteris paribus (all else being equal) conditional.\n\nWhen we add \"and the transmission is shot,\" we're introducing a condition that:\n1. Directly contradicts the implicit normal conditions\n2. Provides an independent reason why the car would NOT run smoothly\n3. Makes the consequent false regardless of the oil change\n\nA shot transmission would prevent the car from running smoothly no matter what we do with the oil. The transmission is essential for the car's operation, and changing the oil cannot compensate for a failed transmission.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe inference is invalid. The original conditional implicitly assumes normal operating conditions for other major components. Adding \"the transmission is shot\" violates these background assumptions and introduces a defeating condition that would prevent the car from running smoothly, making the new conditional false.\n\nAnswer: no",
