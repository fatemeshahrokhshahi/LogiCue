If the computer is on fire, it cannot be used to play video games\n2. The ability to play video games (the consequent) causally depends on having a functioning computer\n3. The fire makes it physically impossible to fulfill the consequent\n\n**Pragmatic Interpretation:**\nThe original statement implicitly assumes normal conditions where finishing homework removes the only barrier to gaming. Adding \"computer catches on fire\" introduces a new, independent barrier that prevents the consequent from being true, regardless of homework completion.\n\nThis is a clear case where formal logical validity conflicts with real-world reasoning. The added condition undermines the very possibility of the consequent being realized, making the inference pragmatically invalid even if formally valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
