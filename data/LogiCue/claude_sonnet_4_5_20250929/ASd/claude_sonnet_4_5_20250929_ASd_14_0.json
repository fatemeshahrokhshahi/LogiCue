This is a reasonable background assumption for any test-taking scenario.\n\nAdding \"and the test is in Chinese\" could fundamentally undermine this assumption. If I don't speak Chinese, then:\n- Studying hard (in English or another language I know) would not help me pass a Chinese test\n- The additional condition contradicts the implicit assumption that I can understand the test language\n- The causal relationship between studying hard and passing breaks down\n\nThis is similar to the examples given where adding conditions that contradict implicit assumptions (like \"the match is soaking wet\" when we assume normal conditions for striking matches) makes the inference invalid.\n\nIf I don't speak Chinese, studying hard would not lead to passing a Chinese test, making the strengthened conditional false even though the original might be true (for tests in languages I understand).\n\nAnswer: no",
