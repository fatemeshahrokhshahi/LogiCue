This would suggest the inference is valid.\n\nHowever, I must consider the real-world context and implicit assumptions:\n\nThe original conditional \"If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time\" carries implicit normal conditions - it assumes circumstances are reasonably normal when we attend the concert. The statement implicitly means \"If we go to the concert (under normal circumstances), then we'll have a good time.\"\n\nAdding \"and a bomb goes off\" introduces an extreme abnormal condition that:\n1. Directly contradicts the implicit normalcy assumptions\n2. Would obviously prevent having a good time (causing terror, injury, death)\n3. Makes the consequent clearly false\n\nThis is a paradigmatic example of where formal logical rules break down when applied to real-world conditionals. The added condition doesn't just strengthen the antecedent - it introduces circumstances that fundamentally undermine the causal or evidential relationship that made the original conditional true.\n\nThe original statement's truth depends on normal concert-going conditions. A bomb going off destroys those conditions entirely, making it absurd to maintain we'd still have a good time.\n\nThis is exactly the type of case where we should not mechanically apply formal logic rules without considering implicit background assumptions.\n\nAnswer: no",
