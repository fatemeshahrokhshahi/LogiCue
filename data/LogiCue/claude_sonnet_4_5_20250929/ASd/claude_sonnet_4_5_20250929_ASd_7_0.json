            "content": "I need to evaluate whether \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm\" follows from \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\"\n\nLet me consider this carefully:\n\n**Formal logical perspective:**\nFrom a purely formal standpoint, this looks like strengthening the antecedent. If P → Q, does (P ∧ R) → Q follow? In classical logic, yes - if P is sufficient for Q, then P combined with anything else is still sufficient for Q.\n\n**Practical considerations:**\nHowever, I need to consider the real-world context and implicit assumptions:\n\n1. **What does \"oven is on\" mean?** In normal usage, \"the oven is on\" typically means it's functioning and producing heat. This usually requires the pilot light (in gas ovens) or heating elements (in electric ovens) to be working.\n\n2. **Contradiction in the antecedent:** \"The oven is on AND the pilot light is out\" creates a problematic scenario for gas ovens. If the pilot light is out, a gas oven typically cannot be \"on\" in the functional sense - it wouldn't be producing heat.\n\n3. **Implicit assumptions:** The original conditional \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm\" implicitly assumes normal operating conditions - that \"on\" means functioning properly.\n\n4. **The new antecedent violates these assumptions:** Adding \"and the pilot light is out\" contradicts the normal conditions implicit in \"the oven is on.\"\n\nThis is similar to the examples in the guidance about adding conditions that contradict implicit background assumptions. The inference fails because the additional condition undermines what \"the oven is on\" normally means.\n\nAnswer: no",
