From \"P → Q\" we cannot automatically infer \"(P ∧ R) → Q\" because R might prevent Q from occurring.\n\n**Real-world context:**\nThe original conditional \"If you scream, it will hurt my ears\" implicitly assumes normal conditions - that my ears are unprotected and functioning normally. Wearing earplugs is precisely the kind of condition that would block the causal mechanism by which screaming hurts ears.\n\nEarplugs are specifically designed to prevent loud sounds from hurting ears. Adding \"I am wearing earplugs\" introduces a condition that directly contradicts the implicit normal circumstances under which screaming would hurt my ears.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe additional condition (wearing earplugs) is a defeater that blocks the usual causal connection between screaming and ear pain. This is not a valid inference because the new antecedent includes a condition that prevents the consequent from following.\n\nAnswer: no",
