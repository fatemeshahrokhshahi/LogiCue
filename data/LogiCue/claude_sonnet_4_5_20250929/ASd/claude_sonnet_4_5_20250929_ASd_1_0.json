This is a valid inference in classical logic.\n\n**Real-World Context:**\nHowever, the original conditional \"If the match is struck, then it will light\" contains implicit background assumptions - namely, that the match is in normal conditions (dry, has phosphorus intact, oxygen present, etc.). These are ceteris paribus conditions.\n\nThe condition \"soaked in water\" directly contradicts these implicit normal conditions. A wet match will not light when struck, regardless of what the original conditional states. The original statement implicitly assumes the match is not soaked in water.\n\n**Applying the Guidance:**\nThe instructions warn against mechanically applying formal logical rules without considering implicit assumptions. The real-world conditional about matches has built-in normal conditions. Adding \"soaked in water\" to the antecedent contradicts these implicit assumptions, making the inference unsound in practice.\n\nWhile the inference is formally valid in classical logic, it produces a false conclusion in reality because it violates the implicit ceteris paribus conditions of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
