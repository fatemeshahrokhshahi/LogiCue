            "content": "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nGiven premises:\n1. \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\"\n2. \"The book might not be resting on the table\"\n\nThe first premise presents a disjunction: (Book is on shelf) OR (Book must be resting on table)\n\nThe second premise states: \"The book might not be resting on the table\"\n\nThis is a key point: \"might not be resting on the table\" means \"possibly not resting on the table\" - it expresses uncertainty or possibility, not a definitive negation.\n\nTo use disjunctive syllogism (Either A or B + Not B → A), we would need a definitive statement that the book is NOT resting on the table. However, \"might not be resting on the table\" only indicates that it's possible the book isn't on the table - it doesn't definitively rule out that the book is on the table.\n\nSince we only have information about a possibility (not a certainty), we cannot eliminate one disjunct and conclude the other must be true. The book could still be resting on the table (the \"might not\" allows for this), so we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no",
