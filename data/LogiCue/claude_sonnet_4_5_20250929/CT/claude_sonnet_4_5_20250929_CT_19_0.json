    "system_prompt": "In classical logic, (P → Q) is equivalent to (¬Q → ¬P). This is valid for the material conditional. However, natural language \"if\" is not a material conditional. It implies a connection or dependence between P and Q.\n\nTherefore, the inference from \"If P, then Q\" to \"If not Q, then not P\" is INVALID for natural language.\n\nCounterexample: \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\" can be true (light rain). But its contrapositive, \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining,\" is a contradiction and is always false.\n\nNow apply this reasoning to the following question and answer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

In classical logic, a conditional and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nUnlike the counterexample I provided earlier (which involved a self-contradictory statement), this statement involves two independent propositions about different people watching different sports. There's no logical contradiction or special semantic relationship that would break the contrapositive inference.\n\nFor standard conditional statements like this one, the contrapositive inference is valid.\n\n**yes**",
