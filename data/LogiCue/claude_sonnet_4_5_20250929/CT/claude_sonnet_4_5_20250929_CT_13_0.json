It implies a connection or dependence between P and Q.\n\nTherefore, the inference from \"If P, then Q\" to \"If not Q, then not P\" is INVALID for natural language.\n\nCounterexample: \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\" can be true (light rain). But its contrapositive, \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining,\" is a contradiction and is always false.\n\nNow apply this reasoning to the following question and answer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

In classical logic, a conditional and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether natural language \"if...then\" statements always behave like material conditionals. The key question is whether there's a causal or definitional connection implied.\n\nIn this case, \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" appears to be a simple factual conditional about two independent properties (a car's color and a truck's color). There's no implied causal connection or definitional relationship that would break under contraposition.\n\nUnlike my counterexample about rain (which involved a contradiction), this statement involves two independent facts. If we accept that the car being red guarantees the truck was blue, then finding the truck was not blue does validly allow us to conclude the car was not red.\n\n**yes**",
