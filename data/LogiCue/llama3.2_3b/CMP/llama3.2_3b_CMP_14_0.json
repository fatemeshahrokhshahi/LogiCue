    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",
