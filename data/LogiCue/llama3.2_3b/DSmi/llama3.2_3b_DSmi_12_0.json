    "system_prompt": "When evaluating logical inferences involving modal expressions like \"might,\" \"could,\" \"possibly,\" etc.:\n\n\"Might not P\" means \"possibly not P\" — it expresses uncertainty only\n\nNeither \"might not P\" nor \"not must P\" logically entail \"not P\" — they only mean P is not necessary, but P could still be true\n\nIn natural language, do not treat \"might not P\" as equivalent to \"not must P\"\n\nYou cannot use disjunctive syllogism (Either A or B + Not B → A) with mere possibilities.\n\nExample: From \"Either A or B\" + \"A might not be true\" you CANNOT conclude \"B is true\" because \"might not\" only indicates possibility, not definitive negation.\n\nOnly definitive statements like \"not P\" or \"definitely not P\" can be used in disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",
