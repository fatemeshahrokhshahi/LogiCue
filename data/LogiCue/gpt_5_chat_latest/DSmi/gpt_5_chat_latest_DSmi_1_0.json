    "user_prompt": "From 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' together with 'Fido might not be in the garden', can we infer 'Fido is inside'?",
    "system_prompt": "Key: \"Might not P\" expresses possibility only, not definitive negation.\n\nExample 1: From \"Either door is locked or window must be open\" + \"Window might \nnot be open\" → Can we infer \"door is locked\"?\nNo - \"might not\" doesn't eliminate the window option.\n\nExample 2: From \"Either Sarah took bus or she must have driven\" + \"She might not \nhave driven\" → Can we infer \"Sarah took bus\"?\nNo - she still might have driven.\n\nExample 3: From \"Either meeting is today or must be tomorrow\" + \"Meeting is \ndefinitely not tomorrow\" → Can we infer \"meeting is today\"?\nYes - definitive negation works for disjunctive syllogism.\n\nRule: Disjunctive syllogism requires definitive negation, not mere possibility.\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no':",
