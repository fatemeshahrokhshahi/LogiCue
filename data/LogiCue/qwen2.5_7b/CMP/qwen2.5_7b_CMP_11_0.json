    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn’t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn’t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn’t lead in sales, Honda will?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",
