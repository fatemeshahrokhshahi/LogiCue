    "user_prompt": "Suppose that thrillers, romances, and mysteries are the top-selling fiction genres. Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren’t #1, then if thrillers aren’t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if thrillers aren’t #1, mysteries will be?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",
