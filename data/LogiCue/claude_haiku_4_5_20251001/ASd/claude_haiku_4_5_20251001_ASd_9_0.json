            "content": "Let me work through this carefully.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If well-written, then A\"\nThe proposed inference is: \"If well-written AND turned in late, then A\"\n\nFrom a formal logic perspective, this inference is **invalid**. Here's why:\n\nIn formal logic, if we have P → Q, we cannot validly infer (P ∧ R) → Q. Adding an additional condition to the antecedent doesn't preserve the truth of the consequent.\n\nMore importantly, in the real-world context of grading:\n- The original statement likely operates under the implicit assumption of normal conditions (e.g., the essay is submitted on time, follows requirements, etc.)\n- \"Turned in late\" contradicts this normal background assumption\n- Late submission typically triggers penalties that override other positive factors\n- So adding \"turned in late\" to the antecedent actually undermines the original conditional's applicability\n\nThe original conditional's guarantee of an A depends on meeting standard expectations. Late submission violates those expectations, so we cannot infer that the consequent (getting an A) still holds.\n\nAnswer: no",
