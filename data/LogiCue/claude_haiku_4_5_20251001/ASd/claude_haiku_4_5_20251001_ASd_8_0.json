If we know that P → Q is true, then (P ∧ R) → Q must also be true. Adding conditions to the antecedent doesn't invalidate the consequent.\n\nHowever, the instruction asks me to consider real-world context and implicit assumptions. In this case, there's a significant practical issue:\n\nThe original statement carries an implicit assumption that normal conditions hold—that the package follows its intended route. When we add \"and it was misrouted\" to the antecedent, we're explicitly contradicting one of those normal background conditions that made the original statement reasonable.\n\nIn real-world reasoning, adding a condition that contradicts the implicit assumptions of the original statement creates a problematic inference. A misrouted package would typically NOT arrive today, which conflicts with the consequent.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of case where mechanical application of formal logic rules would be misleading without considering the pragmatic context.\n\nAnswer: no",
