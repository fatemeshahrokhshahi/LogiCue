            "content": "Let me work through this carefully.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" (If P, then not Q)\n\nThe proposed inference is: \"If you get enough sleep AND do hard labor, you won't be tired\" (If P and R, then not Q)\n\nFrom a formal logic perspective, this inference is **invalid**. Here's why:\n\nThe original statement tells us that sleep alone is sufficient to prevent tiredness. However, it says nothing about what happens when you combine sleep with hard labor. Hard labor is an additional factor that could independently cause tiredness.\n\nIn the real world, the implicit background assumption in the original statement is that normal conditions hold (no extraordinary exertion, etc.). Adding \"do hard labor\" violates this assumption and introduces a new causal factor that could override the effect of sleep.\n\nEven if we tried to formalize this: P → ¬Q does not logically entail (P ∧ R) → ¬Q, because R could be a factor that makes Q true regardless of P.\n\nAnswer: no",
