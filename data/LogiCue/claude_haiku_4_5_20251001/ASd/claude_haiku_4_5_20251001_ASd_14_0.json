Adding a conjunct to the antecedent creates a stronger condition that doesn't necessarily preserve the truth of the consequent.\n\n**Real-world reasoning:**\nThe original statement carries an implicit assumption: normal conditions hold (the test is in a language I understand, it covers material I studied, etc.). \n\nAdding \"and the test is in Chinese\" violates this implicit background assumption if I don't speak Chinese. This contradicts the normal conditions that made the original conditional true.\n\nIf the test being in Chinese is compatible with the original statement's background assumptions (e.g., I study Chinese), then adding it wouldn't change the inference. But if it contradicts those assumptions, the new conditional becomes false even if the original was true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe cannot reliably infer the new statement. The addition of \"the test is in Chinese\" potentially introduces a condition that undermines the original conditional's truth conditions.\n\nAnswer: no",
