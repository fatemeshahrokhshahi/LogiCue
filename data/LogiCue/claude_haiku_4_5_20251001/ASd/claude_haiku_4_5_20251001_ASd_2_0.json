If P→Q is true, then (P∧R)→Q is also logically valid, because whenever the antecedent (P∧R) is true, P must also be true, and therefore Q must be true.\n\nHowever, the instruction asks me to consider real-world context and implicit assumptions. The original statement carries an implicit assumption of \"normal conditions\" - that nothing catastrophic interferes with the concert experience. A bomb going off directly contradicts this background assumption.\n\nThe original conditional relies on an implicit \"all else being equal\" or \"barring extraordinary circumstances.\" Adding \"a bomb goes off\" explicitly violates those normal conditions that make the original statement reasonable.\n\nIn real-world reasoning, we wouldn't accept this inference because it exploits the gap between formal validity and the pragmatic meaning of the original statement. The original statement implicitly assumes the concert proceeds normally.\n\nAnswer: no",
