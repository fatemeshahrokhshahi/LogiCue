    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the distinction between content and modal claims.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The remote control is on the coffee table (content claim)\n2. It must be hiding under the couch (necessity claim)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\"\n\nThis negates only the necessity - it says the remote control need not be hiding under the couch. This does NOT tell us whether the remote control actually IS hiding under the couch or not.\n\nNow, applying the disjunction:\n- We know: NOT(it must be hiding under the couch)\n- But this only eliminates option 2 as a necessary truth\n- Option 2 as a mere possibility (the remote could still be under the couch, just not necessarily)\n- Option 1 (on the coffee table) is not forced to be true\n\nThe disjunction \"Either A or B must be true\" requires at least one disjunct to hold. We've eliminated that B is necessary, but B could still be true contingently. This doesn't force A to be true.\n\nAnswer: no",
