    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the distinction between content and modal claims.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The sock is in the laundry basket (content claim)\n2. It must be the case that the sock is under the bed (modal claim about necessity)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\"\n\nThis negates only the necessity - it says the sock need not necessarily be under the bed. This does NOT negate that the sock could actually be under the bed.\n\nNow, from the first disjunction, we know at least one of these holds:\n- Either: The sock is in the laundry basket\n- Or: The sock must be under the bed\n\nThe second statement tells us the second disjunct is false (the necessity doesn't hold).\n\nHowever, the second statement being true is compatible with the sock actually being under the bed - it just means it's not *necessarily* there. So we cannot definitively conclude that the first disjunct must be true.\n\nThe sock could still be under the bed (just not necessarily so), which would satisfy the original disjunction without requiring the sock to be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: no",
