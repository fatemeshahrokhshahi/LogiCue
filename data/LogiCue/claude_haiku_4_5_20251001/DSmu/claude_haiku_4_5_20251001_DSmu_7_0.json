    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the distinction between content and modal claims.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The umbrella is in the car (content claim)\n2. It must be tucked away in the closet (necessity claim)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet\"\n\nThis negates only the necessity - it says the umbrella need not be tucked away in the closet. This does NOT tell us whether the umbrella actually is or isn't in the closet.\n\nNow, applying disjunctive reasoning:\n- We know: A or B (where B is a necessity claim)\n- We know: NOT B (the necessity doesn't hold)\n- Can we conclude: A?\n\nNo. The negation of \"it must be tucked away\" only eliminates the modal claim. But the original disjunction was between a content claim (in the car) and a modal claim (must be in closet). Eliminating the modal claim doesn't force us to the content claim, because the umbrella could simply be in the closet without being *necessarily* there.\n\nThe umbrella could be in the closet (contingently), satisfying the original disjunction, while the second statement is also true (it's not necessary that it's there).\n\nAnswer: no",
