    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the distinction between content and modal claims.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The cat is napping on the couch (content claim)\n2. It must be the case that the cat is playing in the bedroom (modal claim about necessity)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\"\n\nThis negates only the necessity - it says the cat need not be playing in the bedroom. The cat could still be playing in the bedroom; it's just not necessarily so.\n\nNow, from the first statement, we know at least one of these must hold:\n- Either: The cat is napping on the couch\n- Or: The cat must be playing in the bedroom\n\nThe second statement tells us the second disjunct is false (the necessity doesn't hold).\n\nHowever, this doesn't guarantee the first disjunct is true. The cat could be:\n- Napping on the couch, OR\n- Actually playing in the bedroom (just not necessarily/must-ably so), OR\n- Doing something else entirely\n\nWe cannot validly infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: no",
