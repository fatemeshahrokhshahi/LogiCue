    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the distinction between content and modal claims.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The pen is in my bag (content claim)\n2. It must be the case that the pen is on my desk (modal claim about necessity)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\"\n\nThis negates only the necessity - it says the modal claim (2) is false. This means the pen is not necessarily on my desk, but the pen could still actually be on my desk.\n\nNow, applying disjunctive syllogism:\n- We have: A or B (where B is a modal claim)\n- We know: not B\n- Therefore: A\n\nSince \"it must be on my desk\" is false, and we have a disjunction where one disjunct is \"the pen is in my bag\" and the other is \"it must be on my desk,\" we can validly conclude that the pen is in my bag.\n\nThe key difference from the problematic case is that here the negation directly targets the modal claim that appears in the disjunction, so the inference works.\n\nAnswer: yes",
