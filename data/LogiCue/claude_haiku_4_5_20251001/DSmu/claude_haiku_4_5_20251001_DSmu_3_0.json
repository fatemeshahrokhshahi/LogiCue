    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the distinction between content and modal claims.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The keys are in the drawer (content claim)\n2. The keys must be dangling in the cabinet (modal claim - necessity)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\"\n\nThis negates only the necessity - it says the keys need not necessarily be in the cabinet. This does NOT negate the possibility that they are actually in the cabinet.\n\nNow, applying the disjunction:\n- We know that either (1) or (2) must hold\n- We've eliminated (2) - the keys don't necessarily have to be in the cabinet\n- But this doesn't force us to conclude (1)\n\nThe keys could actually be in the cabinet (just not necessarily so), which would satisfy the original disjunction without requiring them to be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we cannot validly infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no",
