    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the distinction between content and modal claims.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The phone is in the living room (content claim)\n2. The phone must be ringing in the kitchen (modal claim - necessity)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen\"\n\nThis negates only the necessity - it says the phone need not be ringing in the kitchen. This does NOT tell us whether the phone is actually ringing in the kitchen or not.\n\nNow, from the disjunction, we know at least one of these must hold:\n- Either: The phone is in the living room\n- Or: The phone must be ringing in the kitchen\n\nThe second statement only tells us that the second disjunct (the necessity) is false. However, this doesn't force the first disjunct to be true, because:\n- The phone could actually be ringing in the kitchen (just not necessarily so)\n- Or the phone could be in the living room\n\nSince we cannot rule out that the phone is actually ringing in the kitchen (even though it's not *necessarily* ringing there), we cannot definitively conclude that the phone must be in the living room.\n\nAnswer: no",
