    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the distinction between content and modal claims.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The toy is in the toy box (content claim)\n2. It must be sitting on the bookshelf (necessity claim)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\"\n\nThis negates only the necessity - it says the toy need not be sitting on the bookshelf. This does NOT negate that the toy could actually be sitting on the bookshelf; it just says this isn't necessary.\n\nNow, from the disjunction, we know at least one disjunct must be true:\n- Either: the toy is in the toy box, OR\n- The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\n\nThe second statement tells us the second disjunct (the necessity claim) is false. \n\nSince one of the two disjuncts must be true, and the second disjunct is false, the first disjunct must be true.\n\nTherefore: The toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
