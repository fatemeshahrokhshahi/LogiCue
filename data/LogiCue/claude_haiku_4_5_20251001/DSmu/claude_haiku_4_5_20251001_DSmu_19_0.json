    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the modal logic distinction.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The watch is charging on the dresser (simple proposition)\n2. It must be on his wrist (modal claim about necessity)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\"\n\nThis negates only the *necessity* - it says the watch need not be on his wrist. This does NOT tell us whether the watch actually IS on his wrist or not.\n\nNow, applying the disjunction:\n- We know: NOT(the watch must be on his wrist)\n- This eliminates the second disjunct\n\nHowever, the second disjunct was specifically the *modal claim* \"it must be on his wrist,\" not the simple claim \"it is on his wrist.\"\n\nThe watch could still actually be on his wrist - just not necessarily so. The negation of the modal claim doesn't guarantee the first disjunct is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot validly infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
