    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the distinction between content and modal claims.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The newspaper is in the driveway (content claim)\n2. It must be sitting on the porch (necessity claim)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch\"\n\nThis negates only the necessity - it says the newspaper need not be on the porch. This does NOT tell us whether the newspaper actually IS on the porch or not.\n\nNow, applying the disjunction:\n- We know: Either (A) or (B must be true)\n- We know: NOT (B must be true)\n\nFrom \"NOT (B must be true)\" we can only conclude that B is not necessarily true. But B could still be true contingently - the newspaper could actually be on the porch, just not necessarily so.\n\nSince the disjunction requires at least one disjunct to be true, and we've only eliminated the necessity of the second disjunct (not the possibility of it being true), we cannot definitively conclude that the first disjunct (the newspaper is in the driveway) must be true.\n\nAnswer: no",
