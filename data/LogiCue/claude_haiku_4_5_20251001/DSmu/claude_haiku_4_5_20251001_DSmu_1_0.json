    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the distinction between content and modal claims.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. Fido is inside (content claim)\n2. Fido must be in the garden (modal claim - necessity)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\"\n\nThis negates the necessity - it says Fido need not be in the garden. This eliminates option 2 from the disjunction.\n\nSince we have a disjunction \"Either A or B\" and we've established that B (the modal claim) is false, we can validly conclude A.\n\nIn this case:\n- A = \"Fido is inside\"\n- B = \"Fido must be in the garden\"\n\nWith B negated, A must be true.\n\nThis is different from the general principle I outlined because here the disjunction explicitly pairs a content claim with a modal claim, and we're negating the modal claim. The logical structure of the disjunction itself supports the inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
