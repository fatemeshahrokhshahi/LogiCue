    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the distinction between content and modal claims.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The scarf is stuffed in my backpack (content claim)\n2. It must be the case that the scarf is draped on the coat rack (modal claim about necessity)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\"\n\nThis negates only the *necessity* - it says the scarf need not be draped on the coat rack. This does NOT tell us whether the scarf actually is or isn't on the coat rack.\n\nNow, applying the disjunction:\n- For the disjunction to be satisfied, at least one disjunct must be true\n- The second disjunct (the necessity claim) is false\n- Therefore, the first disjunct must be true: the scarf is stuffed in my backpack\n\nIn this case, the modal operator applies to the entire second disjunct, and negating that necessity does eliminate that disjunct from the disjunction. This is different from the general principle I outlined - here we can validly conclude the first disjunct.\n\nAnswer: yes",
