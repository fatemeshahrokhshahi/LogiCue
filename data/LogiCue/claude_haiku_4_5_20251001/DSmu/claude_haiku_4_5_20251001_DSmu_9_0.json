    "user_prompt": "From 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor' together with 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor', can we infer 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box'?",
    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the modal logic distinction.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The puzzle piece is in the box (A)\n2. It must be blending in on the floor (necessarily B)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\"\n\nThis negates only the *necessity* - it says the puzzle piece need not be blending in on the floor. This does NOT tell us whether the puzzle piece actually is blending in on the floor or not.\n\nSo we have:\n- Either A or (necessarily B)\n- Not (necessarily B)\n\nFrom \"not (necessarily B)\" we can only conclude that B is not necessary. But B could still be true contingently (the piece could actually be on the floor, just not necessarily so).\n\nSince the second disjunct of the first statement is \"it must be blending in on the floor\" (a modal claim), and we've only negated the necessity, we haven't eliminated the possibility that the piece is on the floor in some other way. The disjunction doesn't force us to conclude A.\n\nAnswer: no",
