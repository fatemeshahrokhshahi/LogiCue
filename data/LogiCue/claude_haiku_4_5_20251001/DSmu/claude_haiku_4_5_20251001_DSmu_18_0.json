    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the distinction between content and modal claims.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The notebook is in the drawer (content claim)\n2. It must be the case that the notebook is sitting on the nightstand (modal claim about necessity)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\"\n\nThis negates only the necessity - it says the notebook need not necessarily be on the nightstand. This leaves open that the notebook could actually be on the nightstand, just not necessarily so.\n\nNow, applying disjunctive syllogism:\n- We have: A or (necessarily B)\n- We know: not (necessarily B)\n- Can we conclude: A?\n\nNo. The negation of \"necessarily B\" only tells us that B is not required to be true. But B could still be true contingently. The disjunction \"A or (necessarily B)\" is satisfied if either A is true OR B is necessarily true. When we only know that B is not necessarily true, we cannot rule out that B is actually true (just contingently), which would satisfy the disjunction without A being true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot validly infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no",
