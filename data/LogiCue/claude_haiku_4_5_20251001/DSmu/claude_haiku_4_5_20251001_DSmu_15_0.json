    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let me work through this carefully using the modal logic distinction.\n\nThe first statement: \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\"\n\nThis creates a disjunction between:\n1. The shoes are in the closet (simple proposition)\n2. The shoes must be lined up by the door (necessity claim)\n\nThe second statement: \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door\"\n\nThis negates only the *necessity* - it says the shoes don't *have to* be by the door. This leaves open that they *could* be by the door, just not necessarily.\n\nNow, applying disjunctive syllogism:\n- We have: A or (B must be true)\n- We know: NOT (B must be true)\n- Can we conclude: A?\n\nNo. The negation of \"B must be true\" only tells us the necessity doesn't hold. It doesn't tell us B is false. The shoes could still be by the door (just not necessarily so), which would satisfy the original disjunction without requiring A to be true.\n\nFor the inference to work, we would need \"The shoes are NOT by the door\" - but we only have \"The shoes need not be by the door,\" which is weaker.\n\nAnswer: no",
