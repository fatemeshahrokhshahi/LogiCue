The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\n\nThe question asks if we can conclude: The toy is in the toy box\n\nAnalysis:\n- Statement 2 says \"might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" - this means it's POSSIBLE that it's not there\n- \"Might not\" expresses possibility/uncertainty, NOT a definitive negation\n- To use disjunctive syllogism (Either A or B + Not B → A), we need a definitive statement that B is false\n- \"Might not B\" only means \"possibly not B\" - it doesn't establish that B is definitely false\n\nSince we only have \"might not\" (a possibility) rather than \"definitely not\" or \"is not,\" we cannot definitively rule out that the toy is on the bookshelf. Therefore, we cannot use disjunctive syllogism to conclude the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: no",
