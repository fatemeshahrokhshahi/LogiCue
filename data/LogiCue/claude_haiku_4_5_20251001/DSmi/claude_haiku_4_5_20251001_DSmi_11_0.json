The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch\n\nThe question asks if we can conclude: The newspaper is in the driveway\n\nAnalysis:\n- Statement 2 says \"might not be sitting on the porch\" - this means it's POSSIBLY not on the porch\n- \"Might not\" expresses mere possibility/uncertainty, not a definitive negation\n- To use disjunctive syllogism (Either A or B + Not B → A), we need a definitive statement that B is false\n- \"Might not B\" does NOT provide this definitive negation - it only allows for the possibility that B is false\n\nSince \"might not be on the porch\" doesn't definitively establish that the newspaper is NOT on the porch, we cannot validly apply disjunctive syllogism to conclude that it must be in the driveway.\n\nThe newspaper could still be on the porch; the second statement merely indicates this is uncertain.\n\nAnswer: no",
