The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\n\nThe question is whether we can conclude: The notebook is in the drawer\n\nAnalysis:\n- Statement 2 says \"might not be sitting on the nightstand\" - this means it's *possibly* not there, but doesn't definitively establish that it's NOT on the nightstand\n- \"Might not P\" only indicates uncertainty/possibility; it does NOT mean \"definitely not P\"\n- Disjunctive syllogism requires a definitive negation: \"Either A or B\" + \"Not B\" → \"A\"\n- Here we only have \"possibly not B,\" not \"definitely not B\"\n\nSince we cannot definitively rule out the nightstand as a location, we cannot use disjunctive syllogism to conclude the notebook must be in the drawer. The notebook could still be on the nightstand despite the possibility that it might not be.\n\nAnswer: no",
