The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor\n\nThe question asks if we can conclude: The missing puzzle piece is in the box\n\nAnalysis:\n- Statement 1 is a disjunction: A OR B (where A = \"in the box\" and B = \"blending in on the floor\")\n- Statement 2 says: \"might not be blending in on the floor\" = \"possibly not B\"\n\nTo use disjunctive syllogism (A OR B + NOT B → A), we need a definitive negation of B.\n\nHowever, \"might not B\" only means \"possibly not B\" - it indicates uncertainty and allows for the possibility that B could still be true. It does NOT definitively establish \"NOT B.\"\n\nSince we only have \"possibly not B\" rather than \"definitely not B,\" we cannot validly apply disjunctive syllogism to conclude that A must be true.\n\nThe puzzle piece could still be blending in on the floor (the \"might not\" leaves this open), so we cannot definitively infer it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: no",
