The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\n\nThe question is whether we can use disjunctive syllogism to conclude: \"The sunglasses are in her bag\"\n\nFor disjunctive syllogism to work, we need:\n- Either A or B\n- NOT B (a definitive negation)\n- Therefore: A\n\nHowever, statement 2 says \"might not be perched on her head\" - this means \"possibly not perched on her head.\" This is NOT a definitive negation. It only indicates uncertainty or possibility.\n\n\"Might not be\" does not mean \"is definitely not\" or \"is not.\"\n\nSince we only have a possibility of negation (not a definitive negation), we cannot validly apply disjunctive syllogism. The sunglasses could still be perched on her head; statement 2 merely allows for that possibility to be uncertain.\n\nAnswer: no",
