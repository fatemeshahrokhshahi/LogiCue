The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\n\nThe question asks if we can conclude: The remote control is on the coffee table\n\nAnalysis:\n- Statement 2 says \"might not be hiding under the couch\" - this means it's POSSIBLY not under the couch\n- \"Might not\" expresses mere possibility/uncertainty, not a definitive negation\n- For disjunctive syllogism to work (Either A or B + Not B → A), we need a definitive statement that B is false\n- \"Might not B\" does NOT establish that B is definitely false - it only allows for the possibility that B is false\n\nSince statement 2 only indicates possibility (not a definitive negation), we cannot use disjunctive syllogism to conclude that the remote must be on the coffee table. The remote could still be under the couch; statement 2 merely says it might not be.\n\nAnswer: no",
