The pen might not be on my desk\n\nThe question asks if we can conclude: The pen is in my bag\n\nAnalysis:\n- Statement 2 says \"The pen might not be on my desk\" - this means it's *possibly* not on the desk\n- \"Might not\" expresses possibility/uncertainty, NOT a definitive negation\n- To use disjunctive syllogism (Either A or B + Not B → A), we need a *definitive* negation of one disjunct\n- \"Might not be on my desk\" does NOT definitively establish that the pen is NOT on my desk\n- Since we cannot definitively rule out that the pen is on the desk, we cannot use disjunctive syllogism\n\nThe pen could still be on the desk (the \"might not\" allows for that possibility), so we cannot validly conclude that it must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: no",
