The missing sock might not be under the bed\n\nThe question asks if we can conclude: The missing sock is in the laundry basket\n\nThis appears to be a disjunctive syllogism (Either A or B + Not B → A), but there's a critical problem:\n\nStatement 2 says \"might not be under the bed\" - this means \"possibly not under the bed.\" This expresses uncertainty or possibility, NOT a definitive negation.\n\n\"Might not P\" ≠ \"not P\"\n\nFor disjunctive syllogism to work, we would need a definitive statement like \"The sock is definitely NOT under the bed\" or \"The sock is not under the bed.\"\n\nSince \"might not be under the bed\" only indicates possibility (the sock could still be under the bed), we cannot use it to eliminate the second disjunct. Therefore, we cannot validly conclude that the sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: no",
