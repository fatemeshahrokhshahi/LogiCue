The book might not be resting on the table\n\nThe question asks if we can conclude: The book is on the shelf\n\nAnalysis:\n- Statement 1 gives us a disjunction: A OR B (where A = \"on shelf\", B = \"must be on table\")\n- Statement 2 says: \"might not be on table\" = \"possibly not on table\"\n\nThe key issue: \"Might not be on table\" only expresses possibility/uncertainty about whether the book is on the table. It does NOT definitively establish that the book is NOT on the table.\n\nTo use disjunctive syllogism validly, we would need:\n- Either A or B (true)\n- NOT B (definitive negation)\n- Therefore A\n\nBut we only have:\n- Either A or B (true)\n- Possibly not B (mere possibility, not definitive negation)\n\nSince \"might not\" does not constitute a definitive negation of \"must be on table,\" we cannot apply disjunctive syllogism. The book could still be on the table despite the possibility that it might not be.\n\nAnswer: no",
