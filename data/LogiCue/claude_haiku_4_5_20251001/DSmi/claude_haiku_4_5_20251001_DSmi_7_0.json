The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet\n\nThe question is whether we can conclude: The umbrella is in the car\n\nThe key issue: \"Might not be tucked away in the closet\" means \"possibly not tucked away in the closet\" - it expresses uncertainty or possibility, not a definitive negation.\n\nFor disjunctive syllogism to work (Either A or B + Not B → A), we need a definitive negation of B. We need to know that B is definitely false.\n\nHere, statement 2 only tells us that it's possible the umbrella is not in the closet. This allows for:\n- The umbrella might not be in the closet, OR\n- The umbrella might be in the closet\n\nSince we cannot definitively rule out that the umbrella is in the closet, we cannot use disjunctive syllogism to conclude it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: no",
