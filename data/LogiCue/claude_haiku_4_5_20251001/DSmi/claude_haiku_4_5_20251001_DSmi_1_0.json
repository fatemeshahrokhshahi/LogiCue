Fido might not be in the garden\n\nThe question is whether we can conclude: Fido is inside\n\nAnalysis:\n- Statement 2 says \"Fido might not be in the garden\" - this means it's POSSIBLE that Fido is not in the garden\n- \"Might not\" expresses mere possibility, not a definitive negation\n- To use disjunctive syllogism (Either A or B + Not B → A), we need a definitive negation of one disjunct\n- \"Might not be in the garden\" does NOT definitively establish \"Fido is not in the garden\"\n\nSince \"might not\" only indicates possibility and uncertainty, we cannot use it to eliminate the second disjunct in the disjunction. We cannot conclude that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
