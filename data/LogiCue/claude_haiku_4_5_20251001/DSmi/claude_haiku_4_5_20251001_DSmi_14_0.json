The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\n\nThe question asks if we can conclude: The milk is on the counter\n\nAnalysis:\n- Statement 2 says \"might not be chilling in the fridge\" - this expresses a possibility, not a definitive fact\n- \"Might not\" means \"possibly not\" - it allows for uncertainty about whether the milk is chilling\n- To use disjunctive syllogism (Either A or B + Not B → A), we need a definitive negation\n- \"Might not be chilling\" is NOT the same as \"is definitely not chilling\"\n\nSince statement 2 only establishes that it's *possible* the milk isn't in the fridge (not that it *definitely* isn't), we cannot definitively rule out the second disjunct. Therefore, we cannot validly conclude that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no",
