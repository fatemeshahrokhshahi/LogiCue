The watch might not be on his wrist\n\nThe question asks if we can conclude: The watch is charging on the dresser\n\nThis looks like disjunctive syllogism (Either A or B + Not B → A), but there's a critical problem:\n\nStatement 2 says \"The watch **might not** be on his wrist\" - this means \"possibly not on his wrist,\" indicating uncertainty or possibility.\n\n\"Might not\" does NOT mean \"definitely not\" or \"not on his wrist.\"\n\nFor disjunctive syllogism to work, we would need a definitive negation: \"The watch is definitely NOT on his wrist\" or simply \"The watch is not on his wrist.\"\n\nSince we only have \"might not\" (a possibility), we cannot rule out that the watch IS on his wrist. Therefore, we cannot use disjunctive syllogism to conclude that it must be on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
