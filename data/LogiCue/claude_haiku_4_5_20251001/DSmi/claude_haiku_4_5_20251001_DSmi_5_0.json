The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\n\nThe question asks if we can conclude: The cookies are in the jar\n\nAnalysis:\n- Statement 2 says \"might not be hidden in the pantry\" - this means it's POSSIBLE they are not in the pantry\n- \"Might not\" expresses mere possibility/uncertainty, NOT a definitive negation\n- To use disjunctive syllogism (Either A or B + Not B → A), we need a definitive statement that B is false\n- \"Might not B\" does NOT establish that B is definitely false\n\nSince \"might not be hidden in the pantry\" only indicates possibility and does not definitively establish that the cookies are NOT in the pantry, we cannot apply disjunctive syllogism here.\n\nThe cookies could still be in the pantry (the \"might not\" allows for this possibility), so we cannot definitively conclude they must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: no",
