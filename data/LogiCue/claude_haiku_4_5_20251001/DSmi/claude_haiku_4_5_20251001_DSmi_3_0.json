The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\n\nThe question asks if we can conclude: The keys are in the drawer\n\nThe key issue is analyzing statement 2: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\"\n\n\"Might not\" expresses possibility/uncertainty - it means \"possibly not\" or \"it's possible they are not dangling in the cabinet.\" This does NOT mean \"definitely not dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\nTo use disjunctive syllogism (Either A or B + Not B → A), we need a definitive negation of B. We need to establish that B is definitely false.\n\nHowever, \"might not be dangling in the cabinet\" only tells us it's possible they're not there - it leaves open that they could still be dangling in the cabinet. This is not a definitive negation.\n\nSince we cannot definitively rule out that the keys are dangling in the cabinet, we cannot use disjunctive syllogism to conclude they must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no",
