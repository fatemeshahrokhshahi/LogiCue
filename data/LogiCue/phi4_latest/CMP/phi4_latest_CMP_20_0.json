    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

Initially, we have:\n\n- P(Coffee) > P(Tea) > P(Soda).\n\nIf Coffee does not retain the most morning drinkers, Tea becomes the next likely option because it has a higher probability than Soda. Therefore, if both Coffee and Tea do not retain the most morning drinkers, then Soda will indeed be the one to retain them.\n\nHowever, this doesn't make \"if Coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then Soda will\" likely in terms of probability. When Coffee is eliminated as an option, Tea still has a higher probability than Soda. Thus:\n\n- P(Soda | not Coffee) = P(Soda) / (P(Tea) + P(Soda)).\n\nSince P(Tea) > P(Soda), the conditional probability P(Soda | not Coffee) is less than 0.5, making it unlikely that Soda will retain the most morning drinkers if Coffee doesn't.",
