    "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren’t the top seller, then if banana bread isn’t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn’t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

Initially, we have:\n\n- P(Banana Bread) > P(Chocolate Chip Cookies) > P(Carrot Cake).\n\nIf Banana Bread doesn't occur as the top seller, Chocolate Chip Cookies become the most likely to be the top seller, not Carrot Cake. The conditional \"if Banana Bread isn’t the top seller, then if Chocolate Chip Cookies aren’t, Carrot Cake will be\" does not imply that \"if Banana Bread isn’t the top seller, Carrot Cake will be.\" This is because when Banana Bread is eliminated as an option, Chocolate Chip Cookies still have a higher probability than Carrot Cake. Therefore, it doesn't follow that Carrot Cake will likely be the top seller if Banana Bread isn't.",
