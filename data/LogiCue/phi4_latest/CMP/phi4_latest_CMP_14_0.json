    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

            "content": "No.\n\nThe reasoning is based on the nested conditional probabilities given in the scenario. Initially, we have:\n\n- P(Minimum Wage Hike) > P(Paid Family Leave) > P(Student Loan Forgiveness).\n\nIf the minimum wage hike does not occur, then paid family leave becomes the most likely of the remaining options, not student loan forgiveness. Therefore, even if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, it is more probable that paid family leave will be passed rather than student loan forgiveness.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, then if paid family leave doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen\" does not imply that \"if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\" This is because the probability of paid family leave occurring (given that the minimum wage hike did not occur) remains higher than that of student loan forgiveness. Thus, it's not likely that loan forgiveness will happen if only considering the scenario where the minimum wage hike does not pass.",
