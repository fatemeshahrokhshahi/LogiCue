    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

            "content": "No.\n\nThe reasoning is similar to the example with probabilities X, Y, Z. Initially, economists project that rents (R) are most likely to increase the most, followed by home prices (H), and then mortgage rates (M). The statement \"if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most\" is a nested conditional.\n\nHowever, this does not imply that \"if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\" When rents are eliminated as the option increasing the most, home prices still have a higher likelihood of being the largest increase compared to mortgage rates. Therefore, it's not likely that mortgage rates will be the one to increase the most if rents do not increase the most.",
