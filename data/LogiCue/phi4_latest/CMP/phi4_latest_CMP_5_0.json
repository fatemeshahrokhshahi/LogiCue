    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

Initially, we have:\n\n- \\( P(D) > P(R) > P(L) \\), where \\( D \\), \\( R \\), and \\( L \\) represent Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians gaining the most new voters, respectively.\n\nThe statement \"if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will\" translates to a nested conditional: \n\n- If \\( \\neg R \\), then if \\( \\neg D \\), then \\( L \\).\n\nHowever, this does not imply that:\n\n- If \\( \\neg D \\), then \\( L \\).\n\nThis is because when \\( D \\) doesn't happen, \\( R \\) still has a higher probability than \\( L \\). The nested conditional only becomes relevant if both \\( D \\) and \\( R \\) do not occur. Therefore, the likelihood of \\( L \\) occurring directly from \\( \\neg D \\) alone is not increased; it depends on whether \\( R \\) also does not occur.\n\nThus, it does not follow that it is likely Libertarians will gain the most voters if Democrats don't, based solely on the given conditions.",
