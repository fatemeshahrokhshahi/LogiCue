    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

            "content": "No.\n\nThe reasoning provided in the scenario is similar to the example given about probabilities X, Y, Z. Even though there's a conditional statement \"if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be,\" it does not imply that \"if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be.\" This is because when pizza is eliminated as an option, burgers still have a higher probability of being the top takeout item than tacos. Therefore, the likelihood of tacos becoming the top takeout item when pizza doesn't occur remains low unless tacos' probability becomes comparable to that of burgers, which contradicts the premise that tacos are ordered much less frequently.",
