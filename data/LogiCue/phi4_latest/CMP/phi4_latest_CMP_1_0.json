    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don’t win, then if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won’t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will?",
    "system_prompt": "Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:\n\nGiven three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.\n\nThe nested conditional \"if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen\" does NOT make \"if X doesn't happen, Z will happen\" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.\n\nExample: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.\n\nThe inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has \"much lower odds.\"\n\nAnswer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

Initially, we have:\n\n- P(Lakers) > P(Warriors) > P(Celtics).\n\nIf the Lakers do not win, then among the remaining options (Warriors and Celtics), the Warriors are still more likely to win than the Celtics because P(Warriors | not Lakers) is greater than P(Celtics | not Lakers). \n\nThe probability of the Celtics winning given that the Lakers don't win can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Celtics} \\mid \\text{not Lakers}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Celtics})}{P(\\text{Warriors}) + P(\\text{Celtics})}. \\]\n\nSince P(Warriors) > P(Celtics), this probability is less than 0.5, meaning it's not likely that the Celtics will win if the Lakers don't win. Therefore, it does not follow that it is likely the Celtics will win if the Lakers don’t win.",
