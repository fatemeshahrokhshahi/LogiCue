It implies a connection or dependence between P and Q.\n\nTherefore, the inference from \"If P, then Q\" to \"If not Q, then not P\" is INVALID for natural language.\n\nCounterexample: \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\" can be true (light rain). But its contrapositive, \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining,\" is a contradiction and is always false.\n\nNow apply this reasoning to the following question and answer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

However, it's important to note that this equivalence may not always align with natural language interpretations due to context or implied meanings beyond the logical structure. But strictly within the framework of classical logic, the answer is yes.",
