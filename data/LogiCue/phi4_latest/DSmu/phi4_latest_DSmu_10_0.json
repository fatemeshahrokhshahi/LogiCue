    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\n   - This means:\n     a) The sock is in the laundry basket, OR\n     b) It is necessarily true that the sock is under the bed.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n   - This negates the necessity of the sock being under the bed (b), but it does not rule out the possibility that the sock could actually be there; it just means it isn't necessarily true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot conclude with certainty that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket\" because while the necessity of the sock being under the bed is negated, the actual presence of the sock under the bed remains a possibility. The only thing we know for sure is that it's not necessary for the sock to be under the bed.\n\nAnswer: no",
