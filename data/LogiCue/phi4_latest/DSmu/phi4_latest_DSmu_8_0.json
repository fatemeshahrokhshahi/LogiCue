    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

The remote control is on the coffee table.\n     2. It is necessary that the remote control is hiding under the couch.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it could still be there; it just isn't a necessity.\n\nGiven these statements:\n\n- The first statement presents two possibilities: either the remote is on the coffee table or it must be under the couch.\n- The second statement negates the necessity of the remote being under the couch, but does not confirm its location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" because while the necessity of it being under the couch is negated, this doesn't automatically affirm that it's on the coffee table. It could still be elsewhere or simply not accounted for by these two options.\n\nAnswer: no",
