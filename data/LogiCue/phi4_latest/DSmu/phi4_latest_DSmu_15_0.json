    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

The shoes are in the closet.\n     2. It is necessary that the shoes are lined up by the door.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\"\n   - This negates the necessity of the shoes being lined up by the door, but it does not rule out the possibility that they actually are lined up there; it only means it is not necessary for them to be there.\n\nGiven these two statements:\n\n- The first statement presents a disjunction: either the shoes are in the closet (A), or it must be true that they are lined up by the door (the necessity of B).\n- The second statement negates the necessity of B, but does not provide information about whether B itself is true.\n\nTherefore, from \"Either A or B must be true\" and \"B need not be true,\" we cannot conclude A. In this case, we cannot definitively infer that \"The shoes are in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
