    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

The puzzle piece is in the box.\n     2. It is necessary that the puzzle piece is blending in on the floor.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n   - This negates the necessity of the puzzle piece being on the floor, but it does not rule out the possibility that it could still be there; it just isn't necessary.\n\nGiven these statements:\n\n- The first statement presents a disjunction between two possibilities: either the piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\n- The second statement negates the necessity of the puzzle piece being on the floor, but does not confirm its presence or absence there.\n\nTherefore, from \"Either A or B must be true\" and \"B need not be true,\" we cannot conclude that A is true. In this case:\n\n- We cannot definitively infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
