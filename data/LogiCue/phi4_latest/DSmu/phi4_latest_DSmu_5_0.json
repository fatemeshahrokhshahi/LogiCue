    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

The cookies are in the jar.\n     2. It is necessary that the cookies are hidden in the pantry.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This negates the necessity of the cookies being hidden in the pantry, but it does not rule out the possibility that they could still be hidden there; it just means it is not necessary for them to be there.\n\nGiven these two statements:\n\n- The first statement presents a disjunction: either the cookies are in the jar or it must be true that they are hidden in the pantry.\n- The second statement negates the necessity of the cookies being hidden in the pantry, but does not confirm their location.\n\nTherefore, from \"Either A or B must be true\" and \"B need not be true,\" we cannot conclude A. In this case:\n\n- We cannot definitively infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
