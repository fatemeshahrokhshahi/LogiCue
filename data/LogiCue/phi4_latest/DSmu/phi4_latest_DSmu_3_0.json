    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This means:\n     1. The keys are in the drawer.\n     2. It is necessary that the keys are dangling in the cabinet.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This negates the necessity of the keys being in the cabinet, but it does not rule out the possibility that they could still be there; it just means they don't have to be.\n\nGiven these statements:\n\n- The first statement presents a disjunction between two possibilities: either the keys are in the drawer or it is necessary for them to be in the cabinet.\n- The second statement negates the necessity of the keys being in the cabinet, but does not confirm their presence there.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The keys are in the drawer\" because while the necessity of them being in the cabinet is negated, it doesn't affirmatively place them in the drawer. They could still be dangling in the cabinet without necessity.\n\nAnswer: no",
