    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "To evaluate this argument, let's break it down using the distinctions between content and modal claims:\n\n1. \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" is a disjunction that includes:\n   - A: The sunglasses are in her bag.\n   - Modal claim B: The necessity of the sunglasses being perched on her head.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" negates the necessity of B, meaning it's possible for the sunglasses to be somewhere else (like in her bag), but it doesn't confirm they are there.\n\nGiven these points:\n- The first statement allows for two possibilities: either A is true or B is necessarily true.\n- The second statement tells us that B is not necessarily true, which means B could still happen by chance, but it's not a necessity.\n\nSince the negation of the necessity of B does not confirm A (the sunglasses being in her bag), we cannot definitively conclude that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
