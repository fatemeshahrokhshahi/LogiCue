    "system_prompt": "When evaluating arguments with \"must,\" distinguish between:\n- Content: \"Fido is in the garden\"\n- Modal claim: \"Fido must be in the garden\" (necessity)\n\n\"Either A or B must be true\" creates a disjunction between:\n1. A\n2. The necessity of B (not just B itself)\n\n\"It's not the case that B must be true\" only negates the necessity - B could still be true, just not necessarily so.\n\nTherefore: \"Either A or B must be true\" + \"B need not be true\" does NOT allow you to conclude A.\n\nExample: \"Either it's raining or it must be sunny\" + \"It need not be sunny\" ≠ \"It's raining\"\n\nAfter applying this reasoning, write 'Answer: ' followed by only 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.",

            "content": "Let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\"\n   - This means:\n     a) The jacket is draped over the chair.\n     b) It is necessary that the jacket is hanging in the closet.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n   - This negates the necessity of the jacket being in the closet, meaning it could still be there but isn't necessarily so.\n\nGiven these statements:\n\n- The first statement presents a disjunction between:\n  1) The jacket is draped over the chair.\n  2) The necessity that the jacket is hanging in the closet.\n\n- The second statement negates the necessity of the jacket being in the closet, meaning it could be there but isn't necessarily so. This does not confirm or deny whether the jacket is actually in the closet; it only removes the necessity.\n\nTherefore, from \"Either A or B must be true\" and \"B need not be true,\" we cannot conclude that A (the jacket is draped over the chair) is true. The jacket could still be hanging in the closet without necessity, but this does not confirm its position as being on the chair either.\n\nAnswer: no",
