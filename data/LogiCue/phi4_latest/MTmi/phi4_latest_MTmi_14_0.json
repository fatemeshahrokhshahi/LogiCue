For modus tollens (If P then Q, not Q, therefore not P) to be valid, you need a definitive negation of Q, not just uncertainty about Q.\n\nIf given 'If P then Q' and 'Q might not be true' (or 'possibly not Q'), you can only conclude 'P might not be true' - NOT 'P is definitely false.'\n\nBefore concluding any logical inference, check: Do I have definitive premises or only statements about possibility? Match your conclusion's certainty level to your premises' certainty level.\n\nApply this reasoning to the following question and answer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.",

This does not provide a definitive negation of Q; it only suggests uncertainty about Q. Therefore, you cannot definitively conclude \"not P\" (that the bear was not in the cave). The correct inference is that \"P might not be true,\" which means the bear might not have been in the cave, but this is not a definite conclusion.",
