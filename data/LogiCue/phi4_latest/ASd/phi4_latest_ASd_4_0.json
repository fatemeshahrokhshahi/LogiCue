However, if we add the additional condition that the dog is asleep, this contradicts the normal assumption that a sleeping dog would not bark. Therefore, the inference \"If the dog is in the yard and it is asleep, then it is barking\" does not logically follow from the original statement because being asleep typically prevents barking.",
