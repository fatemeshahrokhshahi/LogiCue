However, the additional condition of doing hard labor introduces a significant factor that could lead to tiredness regardless of how much sleep one gets.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" does not hold because the added condition (hard labor) contradicts the implicit assumption that getting enough sleep alone is sufficient to prevent tiredness.\n\nAnswer: no",
