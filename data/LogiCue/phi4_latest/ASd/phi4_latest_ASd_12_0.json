However, if the computer catches on fire, it introduces an extraordinary situation that would likely prevent playing video games regardless of whether the homework is finished. The implicit assumption in the original conditional is that there are no such disruptive events preventing the activity (playing video games). Therefore, adding a condition like \"my computer catches on fire\" contradicts this normal circumstance and invalidates the inference.",
