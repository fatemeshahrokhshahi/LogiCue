Changing the oil alone does not address issues with other critical parts like the transmission.\n\nIn the modified statement \"If I change the oil and the transmission is shot,\" the condition of a faulty transmission contradicts the implicit assumption that all necessary components for smooth operation are in working order. Therefore, changing the oil would not ensure that the car runs smoothly if the transmission is shot.\n\nAnswer: no",
