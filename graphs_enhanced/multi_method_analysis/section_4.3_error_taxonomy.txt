    4.3 Error Pattern Analysis

    To understand the nature of reasoning failures, we analyzed the distribution of errors across patterns and prompting methods. Table 5 categorizes errors by their underlying logical mechanism.

    Analysis reveals three distinct error types:

    Modal Negation Errors (MTmu, MTmi, DSmu, DSmi): 77% of zero-shot responses and 67% of Chain-of-Thought responses stem from treating statements like "it's not the case that Q must be true" as equivalent to "Q is definitely false." This confuses denying necessity with asserting falsity. For instance, from "If P then Q must be true" and "not (Q must be true)," models incorrectly apply modus tollens to conclude "not P," failing to recognize that Q might still be contingently true.

    Defeasibility Errors (CT, ASd): 51% of zero-shot responses systematically validate contraposition and antecedent strengthening by applying material conditional logic to natural language "if-then" statements. Models accept invalid inferences like "If the match is struck, it will light" → "If the match is struck and soaked in water, it will light," ignoring implicit normalcy conditions that make natural language conditionals defeasible.

    Probability Preservation Errors (CMP): 79% of zero-shot responses fail to recognize that nested conditionals don't preserve probability. Even with explicit probabilistic scenarios, models struggle to understand that high probability of an antecedent doesn't transfer to high probability of a consequent in complex conditional structures.

    LogiCue's targeted interventions address these specific confusions, reducing modal negation errors by 60 percentage points, defeasibility errors by 26 percentage points, and probability preservation errors by 41 percentage points compared to zero-shot baselines.
