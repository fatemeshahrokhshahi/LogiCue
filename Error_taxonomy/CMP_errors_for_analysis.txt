QUESTION:
Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?

Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?

Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.

Given information:
1. Spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons
2. Forecasts show: likely spring > summer > winter (in terms of vacations)
3. "If summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will" - This means: ¬Summer_most → (¬Spring_most → Winter_most)
4. "Spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't" - This suggests: likely Spring_most, and likely ¬Summer_most

Question: Does it follow that "it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will"?
In other words: likely(¬Spring_most → Winter_most)?

Let me work through this:

From statement 3: ¬Summer_most → (¬Spring_most → Winter_most)
This is equivalent to: ¬Summer_most → (¬Spring_most → Winter_most)

From statement 4: It's likely that ¬Summer_most

Now, if it's likely that ¬Summer_most, and we have the conditional ¬Summer_most → (¬Spring_most → Winter_most), then in the likely scenario where ¬Summer_most holds, we get: (¬Spring_most → Winter_most).

Therefore, it's likely that (¬Spring_most → Winter_most).

ERROR #2 (Question 11)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn’t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn’t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn’t lead in sales, Honda will?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.

Given information:
- Ford is expected to sell the most (Ford likely #1)
- Toyota follows closely behind Ford
- Honda lags significantly behind
- These three brands lead the market
- Conditional: If Toyota isn't #1, then if Ford isn't #1, Honda will be #1
- Ford likely will lead, and hence Toyota likely won't lead

The question asks: Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn't lead in sales, Honda will?

Let me break this down:

1. We're told "if Toyota isn't #1, then if Ford isn't #1, Honda will be #1"
   This can be written as: ¬Toyota#1 → (¬Ford#1 → Honda#1)

2. We're told Ford likely will lead and Toyota likely won't lead.
   So: Likely(Ford#1) and Likely(¬Toyota#1)

3. The question asks: Is it likely that (¬Ford#1 → Honda#1)?

From premise 1: ¬Toyota#1 → (¬Ford#1 → Honda#1)
From premise 2: Likely(¬Toyota#1)

However, "likely ¬Toyota#1" doesn't allow us to conclude that in the scenario where Ford doesn't lead, the conditional applies with high probability. The conditional in premise 1 is stated as a fact (not probabilistic), and we know Toyota likely isn't #1.

Given that Toyota likely isn't #1, and this is stated as fact, then the conditional (¬Ford#1 → Honda#1) should hold.

Therefore, it is likely that if Ford doesn't lead, Honda will.

yes

ERROR #3 (Question 12)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
Suppose that thrillers, romances, and mysteries are the top-selling fiction genres. Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren’t #1, then if thrillers aren’t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if thrillers aren’t #1, mysteries will be?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.

Given information:
- Thrillers will likely be #1, followed by romances, with mysteries far behind
- If romances aren't #1, then if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be
- Thrillers likely will lead sales, and hence romances likely won't be #1

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that, if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be?

Let me break this down:

1. We're told: If romances aren't #1, then (if thrillers aren't #1, then mysteries will be)
   In logic: ¬R → (¬T → M)

2. We're told it's likely that romances won't be #1 (likely ¬R)

3. The question asks: Is it likely that (¬T → M)?

From premise 1: If ¬R is true, then (¬T → M) is true.
From premise 2: ¬R is likely true.

Therefore: (¬T → M) is likely true.

However, there's a tension here: We're also told mysteries are "far behind" and thrillers are likely #1. This suggests that in the unlikely scenario where thrillers aren't #1, it would probably be romances (not mysteries) that are #1, which contradicts the conditional.

But the argument asks whether it follows *from the given premises*, and logically, if we accept that (1) romances likely aren't #1, and (2) if romances aren't #1 then the conditional holds, then yes, it follows that the conditional is likely true.

yes

ERROR #4 (Question 13)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.

Let me define:
- T = Tennessee adds the most jobs
- G = Georgia adds the most jobs
- M = Missouri adds the most jobs

Given premises:
1. "These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will."
   This gives us: ¬G → (¬T → M)

2. "Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won't."
   This gives us: likely(T) and likely(¬G)

Question: Does it follow that likely(¬T → M)?

From premise 1: ¬G → (¬T → M)
This is equivalent to: ¬G → (T ∨ M)

From premise 2: likely(¬G)

Now, the question is whether from:
- ¬G → (¬T → M) [which holds with certainty]
- likely(¬G)

We can conclude: likely(¬T → M)

Since ¬G → (¬T → M) is stated as a fact (not just likely), this means:
- Whenever ¬G is true, (¬T → M) must be true

Given that ¬G is likely true, and whenever ¬G is true we have (¬T → M), it follows that (¬T → M) is likely true.

Therefore: likely(¬T → M)

ERROR #5 (Question 14)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this step-by-step using the given information.

Given facts:
1. Only one new law will be passed
2. Minimum wage hike is most probable
3. Paid family leave is second most probable
4. Loan forgiveness is much less likely
5. If paid leave doesn't happen, then if minimum wage doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen
6. Minimum wage hike likely will happen
7. Therefore, paid leave likely won't happen (given only one law passes)

Question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if minimum wage doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?

Let me denote:
- M = minimum wage hike happens
- P = paid leave happens
- L = loan forgiveness happens

From fact 5: ¬P → (¬M → L)

From fact 6: M is likely
From fact 7: ¬P is likely (because M is likely and only one law passes)

Now, the question asks: Is it likely that (¬M → L)?

Given that ¬P is likely (from the reasoning in the passage), and we have ¬P → (¬M → L), we can conclude that (¬M → L) is likely.

This is because if ¬P is likely true, and ¬P → (¬M → L) is given as true, then (¬M → L) is likely true.

According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.

Let me define:
- S = stocks have the highest returns
- R = real estate has the highest returns  
- B = bonds have the highest returns

Given premises:
1. "These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then if stocks don't, bonds will."
   This gives us: ¬R → (¬S → B)

2. "Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won't."
   This gives us: likely(S) and likely(¬R)

Question: Does it follow that likely(¬S → B)?

From premise 1: ¬R → (¬S → B)
This is logically equivalent to: ¬R → (S ∨ B)

From premise 2: likely(¬R)

Now, the question is whether from:
- ¬R → (¬S → B)
- likely(¬R)

We can conclude: likely(¬S → B)

If ¬R is likely true, and we have ¬R → (¬S → B), then in those likely scenarios where ¬R holds, we also have (¬S → B).

Therefore, it is likely that (¬S → B).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.

Given information:
1. Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the only major transportation providers
2. Uber likely will have the most rides, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer
3. If Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides
4. Uber likely will give the most rides, and hence Lyft likely won't give the most rides

Question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will?

Let me work through this:

From statement 3: ¬Lyft_most → (¬Uber_most → Taxis_most)

This is logically equivalent to: (¬Lyft_most ∧ ¬Uber_most) → Taxis_most

From statement 4: It's likely that Uber gives the most rides, so it's likely that Lyft doesn't give the most rides.

Now, the question asks: Is it likely that (¬Uber_most → Taxis_most)?

From statement 3, we know that IF Lyft doesn't give the most rides, THEN (if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will).

From statement 4, we know it's likely that Lyft doesn't give the most rides.

So it's likely that the antecedent of statement 3 holds, which means it's likely that: (¬Uber_most → Taxis_most).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.

Let me define:
- P = Pizza is the top takeout item
- B = Burgers is the top takeout item  
- T = Tacos is the top takeout item

Given premises:
1. Pizza is likely the top item (likely P)
2. If burgers aren't top, then if pizza isn't top, tacos will be: ¬B → (¬P → T)
3. Pizza likely will lead, hence burgers likely won't: likely P, therefore likely ¬B

Question: Does it follow that: likely (¬P → T)?

From premise 2: ¬B → (¬P → T)
From premise 3: likely ¬B

Now, if ¬B is likely true, and we have ¬B → (¬P → T), can we conclude that (¬P → T) is likely true?

The conditional ¬B → (¬P → T) tells us that in worlds where ¬B holds, (¬P → T) holds.

If ¬B is likely (true in most probable worlds), then in those most probable worlds, (¬P → T) holds.

This means (¬P → T) is true in the most probable worlds, which means it's likely that (¬P → T).

Therefore: yes

ERROR #9 (Question 19)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this step-by-step using the given statements.

Given information:
1. Economists project: rents will likely increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less
2. If home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most
3. Rents likely will increase the most
4. Hence, home prices likely won't increase the most

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that, if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?

Let me denote:
- R = rents increase the most
- H = home prices increase the most
- M = mortgage rates increase the most

From the given:
- Statement 2: ¬H → (¬R → M)
- Statement 3: R is likely
- Statement 4: ¬H is likely (follows from statement 3, since only one can increase the most)

The question asks: Is it likely that (¬R → M)?

From statement 2: ¬H → (¬R → M)

Since ¬H is likely (statement 4), and we have ¬H → (¬R → M), it follows that (¬R → M) is likely.

This is a straightforward application of modus ponens with likelihood: if ¬H is likely, and ¬H implies (¬R → M), then (¬R → M) is likely.

QUESTION:
Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.

Given premises:
1. Coffee, tea, and soda are the only major morning drinks
2. Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers
3. If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers
4. Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers (repeated)
5. Therefore, tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that "if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers"?

From premise 2/4: Coffee likely retains the most → Tea likely doesn't retain the most

From premise 3: If tea doesn't retain the most, then (if coffee doesn't retain the most → soda retains the most)

Since it's likely that tea doesn't retain the most, and we have the conditional in premise 3, we can derive:
- It's likely that (if coffee doesn't retain the most → soda retains the most)

This is exactly what the question asks about.

QUESTION:
Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren’t the top seller, then if banana bread isn’t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn’t the top seller, carrot cake will be?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze whether the conclusion follows from the given premises.

Let me denote:
- B = banana bread is top seller
- C = chocolate chip cookies is top seller  
- K = carrot cake is top seller

Given premises:
1. It is very likely that B (banana bread will be top seller)
2. If ¬C, then (if ¬B, then K) - equivalently: ¬C → (¬B → K)
3. It is likely that B, and hence likely that ¬C

Question: Does it follow that it is likely that (¬B → K)?

The key issue here is about the scope of the likelihood operator and conditional statements.

From premise 2, we have as a factual claim: ¬C → (¬B → K)
This is logically equivalent to: (¬C ∧ ¬B) → K

Now, the question asks whether "likely(¬B → K)" follows.

The conditional (¬B → K) is true in all cases except when ¬B is true and K is false.

Given that:
- B is very likely (so ¬B is unlikely)
- When ¬B occurs, we know from premise 2 that if ¬C also holds, then K must hold
- We're told ¬C is likely

So in the unlikely event that ¬B occurs, ¬C is likely to hold as well, which means K would hold (by premise 2).

However, the conditional (¬B → K) is automatically true whenever B is true (since the antecedent is false). Since B is very likely, the conditional (¬B → K) is very likely to be true.

Therefore, yes, it does follow that it is likely that (¬B → K).

QUESTION:
Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this step-by-step using conditional probabilities.

Given information:
- Three candidates: Priya, Julian, and Diego
- Priya is most likely, Julian second, Diego is a longshot
- If Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will
- It's likely Priya will get the offer
- It's likely Julian won't get the offer

The question asks: Is it likely that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will?

Let me denote:
- P(Priya gets offer) is high
- P(Julian gets offer) is low
- P(Diego gets offer) is low

The key constraint: "If Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will"
This means: If ¬Julian, then (¬Priya → Diego)

Since it's likely Julian won't get the offer, we're likely in the scenario where ¬Julian is true.
In that scenario, the conditional "if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will" holds.

So we're asking about P(Diego | ¬Priya).

Given that:
- One of the three must get the offer
- If Julian doesn't get it, and Priya doesn't get it, then Diego must get it
- Julian is unlikely to get it

Therefore, P(Diego | ¬Priya) should be high, because if Priya doesn't get it and Julian is unlikely to get it, Diego must get it.

ERROR #13 (Question 5)

QUESTION:
Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.

Given information:
- Three parties: Democrats (D), Republicans (R), Libertarians (L)
- Likely outcome: D > R > L (Democrats gain most, Republicans second, Libertarians distant third)
- Conditional fact: If R doesn't gain the most, then if D doesn't gain the most, L will
- Democrats likely will gain the most, so Republicans likely won't gain the most

Question: Does it follow that it is likely that "if D doesn't gain the most, then L will"?

Let me parse this carefully:

The conditional fact states: ¬R → (¬D → L)
This is logically equivalent to: (¬R ∧ ¬D) → L

We're told:
1. It's likely that D gains the most
2. Therefore, it's likely that ¬R (R doesn't gain the most)

The question asks: Is it likely that (¬D → L)?

Now, (¬D → L) is equivalent to (¬D ∧ ¬L) being false, or "either D or L gains the most."

Given that we know ¬R is likely true, and we have the conditional (¬R ∧ ¬D) → L, we can derive:
If ¬R is true (which is likely), then ¬D → L follows from the given conditional.

Since it's likely that ¬R (Republicans won't gain the most), and we have the conditional that applies when ¬R is true, it follows that it is likely that (¬D → L).

Yes

QUESTION:
Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it’s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.

Given information:
1. Tidal, solar, and wind are the only three major renewable sources
2. It's likely tidal power will generate the most electricity
3. Solar is forecasted second, wind significantly behind
4. If solar doesn't generate the most, then if tidal doesn't, wind will
5. Tidal likely will generate the most, hence solar likely won't

Question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal doesn't generate the most, wind will?

Let me parse statement 4: "If solar doesn't generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn't, wind power will."
This means: ¬Solar_most → (¬Tidal_most → Wind_most)

From statement 5: It's likely that tidal generates the most, so it's likely solar doesn't generate the most.

So we have:
- Likely(¬Solar_most)
- From statement 4: ¬Solar_most → (¬Tidal_most → Wind_most)

If it's likely that ¬Solar_most, and we know that ¬Solar_most → (¬Tidal_most → Wind_most), then in the likely scenarios where ¬Solar_most holds, we have (¬Tidal_most → Wind_most).

This means: In likely scenarios, if tidal doesn't generate the most, wind will.

Therefore: It's likely that (if tidal doesn't generate the most, wind will).

QUESTION:
Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.

Let me define:
- I = India is the top-growing emerging economy
- C = China is the top-growing emerging economy  
- R = Russia is the top-growing emerging economy

Given information:
1. It's likely that I (India will grow fastest)
2. These are the biggest emerging economies, so: ¬C → (¬I → R), which is equivalent to ¬C → (I ∨ R)
3. It's likely that I, and hence likely that ¬C

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that (¬I → R)?

From premise 2, we have: ¬C → (¬I → R)

The argument seems to suggest:
- Since it's likely that ¬C (China won't be top)
- And we have ¬C → (¬I → R)
- Therefore, it's likely that (¬I → R)

However, this reasoning is flawed. The conditional ¬C → (¬I → R) tells us that IF China is not top, THEN (if India isn't top, Russia will be). 

But we're also told it's LIKELY that India IS top. So even if we accept that it's likely ¬C is true (making the consequent ¬I → R true in those scenarios), the conditional ¬I → R itself could be vacuously true in likely scenarios where I is true.

The question is whether it's likely that the conditional (¬I → R) holds. Given that these are the only three major emerging economies and the premise states that if C is not top, then if I isn't top, R will be - this conditional ¬I → R would indeed hold in the likely scenarios where ¬C is true.

Yes

QUESTION:
Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it’s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be. Moreover, it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this logical argument carefully.

Given information:
1. Apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits
2. It's likely apples will be top-selling, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly
3. If bananas aren't top seller, then if apples aren't top seller, oranges will be
4. It's likely apples will be top (and hence bananas won't be)

Question: Does it follow that it's likely that "if apples aren't top, then oranges will be"?

Let me work through this:

From statement 3: ¬B → (¬A → O), which is equivalent to: ¬B → (A ∨ O)

The question asks whether: "likely(¬A → O)" follows.

Now, we're told it's likely that apples will be top. This means in the likely scenario, A is true. But the conditional "if apples aren't top, then oranges will be" concerns what happens in the (unlikely) scenario where A is false.

From statement 3, we know: If bananas aren't top, then (if apples aren't top, oranges will be).

We're told bananas likely won't be top (since apples likely will be). So it's likely that ¬B is true.

If ¬B is (likely) true, and we have ¬B → (¬A → O), then (¬A → O) should (likely) hold.

So yes, it follows that it's likely that if apples aren't top, oranges will be.

These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?

QUESTION:
Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical argument step by step.

Given premises:
1. Spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons
2. Most vacations this year will likely happen in spring, followed by summer, with many fewer in winter
3. "These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will" (explicit conditional)
4. Spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?

Let me parse the logical structure:
- Premise 3 states: If summer doesn't have the most, then (if spring doesn't have the most, then winter will)
- This is: ¬S → (¬Sp → W), which is logically equivalent to: (¬S ∧ ¬Sp) → W

The question asks whether we can conclude: It's likely that (¬Sp → W)

From premise 2: Spring likely has the most vacations (Sp is likely true)
From premise 4: Spring likely will have the most travelers, so summer likely won't have the most (¬S is likely true)

If spring likely has the most vacations, then ¬Sp is likely false. When the antecedent of a conditional (¬Sp) is likely false, the conditional (¬Sp → W) is likely true (a conditional with a false antecedent is vacuously true).

So yes, given that spring likely will have the most vacations, it follows that it's likely true that "if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will."

QUESTION:
Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn’t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn’t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn’t lead in sales, Honda will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical problem step by step.

Given statements:
1. Industry analysis expects Ford #1, Toyota #2, Honda #3 (with Honda lagging significantly)
2. "If Toyota isn't #1, then if Ford isn't #1, Honda will be" - This is: ¬T → (¬F → H)
3. "Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won't" - This establishes that Ford likely #1 and Toyota likely not #1

The question asks: Does it follow that "it is likely that, if Ford doesn't lead in sales, Honda will"?
This is asking: Does it follow that it is likely that (¬F → H)?

Let me analyze the logical structure:
- Statement 2 gives us: ¬T → (¬F → H) as a logical fact
- Statement 3 tells us: It is likely that F (Ford leads) and likely that ¬T (Toyota doesn't lead)

Now, the key issue: From "it is likely that ¬T" and the logical rule "¬T → (¬F → H)", can we conclude "it is likely that (¬F → H)"?

If ¬T is likely true, then by modus ponens on the rule ¬T → (¬F → H), we can conclude that (¬F → H) is likely true.

This is a valid inference: if the antecedent of a conditional is likely true, and we have that conditional as a logical rule, then the consequent is likely true.

Since statement 3 establishes that it is likely that ¬T (Toyota won't lead), and statement 2 establishes that ¬T → (¬F → H), it follows that it is likely that (¬F → H).

Answer: yes

QUESTION:
Suppose that thrillers, romances, and mysteries are the top-selling fiction genres. Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren’t #1, then if thrillers aren’t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if thrillers aren’t #1, mysteries will be?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical problem step by step.

Given information:
1. Thrillers will likely be #1
2. Romances will likely be #2
3. Mysteries will likely be far behind
4. "If romances aren't #1, then if thrillers aren't, mysteries will be" (logical statement)
5. "Thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won't"

The question asks: Does it follow that "it's likely that, if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be"?

Let me parse the logical structure:
- Statement 4 says: ¬R1 → (¬T1 → M1), which is logically equivalent to (¬R1 ∧ ¬T1) → M1
- This means: If romances aren't #1 AND thrillers aren't #1, then mysteries will be #1

The question asks whether we can conclude: It's likely that (¬T1 → M1)
- This means: If thrillers aren't #1, then mysteries will be #1

The key issue: Statement 4 only guarantees that mysteries will be #1 if BOTH romances AND thrillers fail to be #1. But the conclusion only requires thrillers to fail to be #1 (it doesn't require romances to also fail).

However, we're told that thrillers "likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won't." This strongly suggests that if thrillers aren't #1, then romances likely won't be #1 either (since thrillers are the strong favorite).

Given that thrillers are likely to be #1, the scenario where thrillers aren't #1 is already an unlikely deviation. In such a scenario, romances (the second favorite) also likely wouldn't be #1. So if thrillers aren't #1, then both thrillers and romances aren't #1, which by statement 4 means mysteries will be #1.

Therefore, yes, it does follow that it's likely that if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be.

Answer: yes

QUESTION:
Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical argument step by step.

Let me define:
- T = Tennessee adds the most jobs
- G = Georgia adds the most jobs
- M = Missouri adds the most jobs

The given statements are:
1. "These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will"
   - This translates to: ¬G → (¬T → M)

2. "Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won't"
   - This tells us: T is likely true, and therefore ¬G is likely true

The question asks: Does it follow that "it's likely that, if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will"?
- This is asking: Does ¬T → M likely follow?

Now let me trace through the logic:

From statement 1: ¬G → (¬T → M)
This is logically equivalent to: (¬G ∧ ¬T) → M

From statement 2: We're told that T is likely true, which means ¬G is likely true.

If ¬G is likely true, then the antecedent of our conditional (¬G → (¬T → M)) is likely satisfied.

When ¬G is true, the conditional ¬G → (¬T → M) tells us that (¬T → M) must be true.

So if ¬G is likely true (which we're told it is), then (¬T → M) is likely true.

Therefore, yes, it does follow that it's likely that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will.

These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical argument step by step.

Let me define:
- S = stocks have the highest returns
- R = real estate has the highest returns
- B = bonds have the highest returns

The given statements are:
1. "If real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then if stocks don't, bonds will"
   This translates to: ¬R → (¬S → B)

2. "Stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won't"
   This tells us: S is likely true, and therefore ¬R is likely true

The question asks: Does it follow that "if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will" is likely?
This is asking: Does ¬S → B follow?

Let me trace through the logic:
- From statement 2: We're told S is likely true, so ¬R is likely true
- From statement 1: ¬R → (¬S → B)
- Since ¬R is likely true, and we have ¬R → (¬S → B), we can conclude that (¬S → B) is likely true

This is a valid application of modus ponens: if we know ¬R is likely true, and we know that ¬R implies (¬S → B), then (¬S → B) is likely true.

Therefore, yes, it does follow that it's likely that if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city.

These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical problem step by step.

First, let me identify the given statements:
1. Uber likely will have the most rides this month
2. Followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides
3. These are the only major transportation providers
4. "If Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides" (logical form: ¬L → (¬U → T))
5. "Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won't give the most rides" (U is likely true, and therefore ¬L is likely true)

The question asks: Does it follow that "it's likely that, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will"? (In other words: is (¬U → T) likely true?)

Let me analyze this:

From statement 4, we have: ¬L → (¬U → T)
From statement 5, we're told that ¬L is likely true (Lyft likely won't give the most rides).

Now, if ¬L is likely true, then by modus ponens applied to statement 4:
- If ¬L is true, then (¬U → T) must be true
- Since ¬L is likely true, then (¬U → T) is likely true

This is a valid inference. When we have a conditional statement (¬L → (¬U → T)) and we establish that the antecedent (¬L) is likely true, we can conclude that the consequent ((¬U → T)) is likely true.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical argument step by step.

Let me define:
- F = flu infects the most people
- C = colds infect the most people
- S = strep infects the most people

Given premises:
1. "If colds don't infect the most people, then if flu doesn't, strep will" = ¬C → (¬F → S)
2. "Flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won't" = F is likely true, and therefore ¬C is likely true

The question asks: Does it follow that "it's likely that, if flu doesn't infect the most, strep will"? = Is (¬F → S) likely true?

Now, let's analyze the logical structure:
- From premise 1: ¬C → (¬F → S)
- From premise 2: We're told F is likely true, which means ¬C is likely true

If ¬C is likely true, and we have ¬C → (¬F → S), then by modus ponens, (¬F → S) is likely true.

In other words:
- We're told it's likely that ¬C (colds won't infect the most)
- We're told that ¬C logically entails (¬F → S)
- Therefore, it's likely that (¬F → S)

This is a valid application of modus ponens with likelihoods: if a premise is likely true and that premise logically entails a conclusion, then the conclusion is likely true.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical argument step by step.

First, let me identify the key statements:
1. Pizza likely will be the top takeout item
2. Burgers likely will be second
3. Tacos ordered much less frequently
4. "If burgers aren't the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn't, tacos will be" - This is: ¬B → (¬P → T)
5. "Pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won't" - This states: P is likely AND ¬B is likely

Now, the question asks: Does it follow that "if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be"? This is asking: Does (¬P → T) follow?

Let me analyze the logical structure:
- Statement 4 says: ¬B → (¬P → T)
- Statement 5 tells us that P is likely true AND ¬B is likely true

If ¬B is likely true (burgers likely won't be top), then from statement 4, we can derive (¬P → T).

So given that burgers likely won't be the top item (which statement 5 asserts), the conditional ¬B → (¬P → T) allows us to conclude (¬P → T).

Therefore, it does follow that it's likely that if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical argument step by step.

First, let me identify the key statements:
1. "If home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most." 
   - In logical form: ¬H → (¬R → M)

2. "Rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won't increase the most."
   - This tells us: R is true, and therefore ¬H is true

3. The question asks: "Does it follow that it's likely that, if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?"
   - In logical form: Does (¬R → M) follow?

Now let me trace through the logic:

From statement 2, we know ¬H is true (home prices won't increase the most).

From statement 1, we have: ¬H → (¬R → M)

Since ¬H is true, and we have a conditional ¬H → (¬R → M), we can apply modus ponens:
- We get: (¬R → M)

This is exactly what the question asks whether it follows.

So yes, from the given premises, we can validly derive that "if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most."

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical argument step by step.

Let me define:
- C = coffee retains the most morning drinkers
- T = tea retains the most morning drinkers
- S = soda retains the most morning drinkers

From the passage, I'm given:
1. "if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers"
   - This is: ¬T → (¬C → S)

2. "coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers"
   - This is: C (likely true)

3. "hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers"
   - This is: ¬T (likely true)

The question asks: Does it follow that "it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers"?
- This is asking: Does (¬C → S) likely follow?

Now, let me trace the logic:
- We're told ¬T is likely true (from statement 3)
- We're told ¬T → (¬C → S) is true (from statement 1)
- If ¬T is true, and we have ¬T → (¬C → S), then by modus ponens, (¬C → S) must be true

Since we've established that ¬T is likely true, and the conditional ¬T → (¬C → S) is stated as a fact, it follows that (¬C → S) is likely true.

Therefore, yes, it does follow that it's likely that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical problem step by step.

Let me define:
- B = banana bread is top seller
- C = chocolate chip cookies is top seller
- R = carrot cake is top seller

Given information:
1. It is very likely that B (banana bread will be top seller)
2. C is likely to be second (chocolate chip cookies follow closely)
3. These are the only top sellers, so: ¬C → (¬B → R)
   This means: if cookies aren't top, then if bread isn't top, cake will be
4. It is likely that B, and hence likely that ¬C

The question asks: Does it follow that it is likely that (¬B → R)?
In other words: Does it follow that it is likely that if banana bread isn't top, carrot cake will be?

Let me analyze this:

From statement 3, we have the logical truth: ¬C → (¬B → R)
This is a tautology given the constraint that only one can be top seller.

From statement 4, we know:
- It is likely that B (so likely that ¬¬B, meaning likely that B is true)
- It is likely that ¬C (cookies won't be top)

Now, the question is whether "it is likely that (¬B → R)" follows.

The conditional ¬B → R is logically entailed by ¬C (from statement 3). Since we're told it's likely that ¬C, and ¬C logically entails ¬B → R, it does follow that it is likely that ¬B → R.

In other words: Given that it's likely chocolate chip cookies won't be top, and given that if cookies aren't top then (if bread isn't top, cake will be), it follows that it's likely that if bread isn't top, cake will be.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical argument step by step.

Let me define:
- D = Democrats gain the most new voters
- R = Republicans gain the most new voters
- L = Libertarians gain the most new voters

Given premises:
1. "These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don't gain the most voters, then if Democrats don't, Libertarians will."
   This means: ¬R → (¬D → L), which is logically equivalent to: (R ∨ D ∨ L) and exactly one party gains the most

2. "Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won't."
   This tells us: D is likely true, and therefore ¬R is likely true

The question asks: Does it follow that "it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will"?
This is asking: Does it follow that ¬D → L is likely true?

From premise 1, we have the logical structure that guarantees: ¬R → (¬D → L)

From premise 2, we know ¬R is likely true (Republicans likely won't gain the most).

Now, if ¬R is likely true, and we have ¬R → (¬D → L), then by modus ponens, (¬D → L) is likely true.

This is exactly what the question asks for.

Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny’s album doesn’t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift’s doesn’t, Beyonce’s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift’s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical problem step by step.

Let me define:
- T = Taylor Swift's album sells the most
- B = Bad Bunny's album sells the most
- Y = Beyoncé's album sells the most

Given facts:
1. "If Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift's doesn't, Beyoncé's will"
   This translates to: ¬B → (¬T → Y)

2. "Taylor Swift's likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't"
   This means: It's likely that T, and therefore likely that ¬B

3. The question asks: Does it follow that "it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyoncé's will"?
   This is asking: Does it follow that it's likely that (¬T → Y)?

Now, let me analyze:

From fact 1: ¬B → (¬T → Y)

From fact 2: It's likely that ¬B (since it's likely that T)

If ¬B is likely true, then by modus ponens on the conditional in fact 1, it's likely that (¬T → Y).

Here's the key reasoning: We're told it's likely that ¬B. Given the conditional ¬B → (¬T → Y), if the antecedent (¬B) is likely true, then the consequent (¬T → Y) is also likely true.

This is a valid application of probabilistic reasoning: if we know that ¬B is likely, and we have a conditional that says ¬B implies (¬T → Y), then (¬T → Y) is likely.

Answer: yes

QUESTION:
Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it’s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical problem step by step.

Let me define:
- T = tidal power generates the most electricity
- S = solar power generates the most electricity
- W = wind power generates the most electricity

Given statements:
1. "if solar power doesn't generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn't, wind power will"
   This translates to: ¬S → (¬T → W)

2. "tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't"
   This means: It's likely that T, and it's likely that ¬S

3. The question asks: Does it follow that "it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will"?
   This is asking: Does it follow that it's likely that (¬T → W)?

Now, let's analyze:
- We're told it's likely that T (tidal power generates the most)
- We're told it's likely that ¬S (solar power doesn't generate the most)
- We're given that ¬S → (¬T → W) is true

The question is whether "it's likely that (¬T → W)" follows.

From statement 1, we know that ¬S → (¬T → W) is logically true (a given fact).

Since we're told it's likely that ¬S is true, and we know that whenever ¬S is true, the conditional (¬T → W) must be true, it follows that it's likely that (¬T → W) is true.

In other words: if ¬S is likely true, and ¬S logically entails (¬T → W), then (¬T → W) is likely true.

QUESTION:
Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical argument step by step.

First, let me identify the key statements:
1. India's economy will likely grow fastest this year
2. China's will likely grow second fastest
3. Russia's will likely grow slowest
4. These are the three biggest emerging economies
5. "If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn't, Russia will be" (given as a logical principle)
6. "India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't" (stated as a conclusion from the premises)

The question asks: Does it follow that "it's likely that, if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be"?

Let me parse the logical structure:
- Statement 5 says: ¬C → (¬I → R), which is logically equivalent to: (C ∨ ¬I ∨ R)
- This means: Either China is top-growing, OR India isn't top-growing, OR Russia is top-growing (or some combination)

Now, the premises tell us it's likely that India IS the top-growing economy (statement 1 and 6).

If India IS the top-growing economy (I is true), then:
- The conditional "if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be" (¬I → R) is vacuously true, because its antecedent is false
- A conditional with a false antecedent is always true

However, the question asks whether it's *likely* that this conditional holds. Since we're told it's likely that India WILL be the top-growing economy, the antecedent of the conditional (¬I) is unlikely to be true. This makes the conditional vacuously true in the likely scenario.

But the logical principle given (statement 5) already establishes that this conditional must hold as a matter of logical necessity (given the three-economy constraint). So yes, it does follow that the conditional holds—in fact, it must hold regardless of which economy actually grows fastest.

Answer: yes

QUESTION:
Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it’s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be. Moreover, it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this logical problem step by step.

Given information:
1. It's likely apples will be top, followed by bananas, with oranges trailing
2. These are the top three fruits (only ones we're considering)
3. "If bananas aren't top, then if apples aren't, oranges will be" - this is a logical statement
4. "It's likely apples will be top and hence bananas won't be" - this tells us it's likely apples is top

The question asks: Does it follow that "it is likely that, if apples aren't top, oranges will be"?

Let me denote:
- A = apples is top
- B = bananas is top
- O = oranges is top

Given statement 3 says: ¬B → (¬A → O), which is logically equivalent to: (B ∨ ¬A ∨ O)

We're told it's likely that A is true (and hence ¬B is likely).

The question asks whether it's likely that: ¬A → O

Now, the key insight: We're told it's LIKELY that A is true. This means scenarios where ¬A is true are relatively unlikely. 

When we ask "is it likely that IF ¬A THEN O?", we're asking about the conditional probability or likelihood in the subset of scenarios where ¬A holds.

Given the constraint that ¬B → (¬A → O) must hold, whenever ¬A is true, we need either B or O to be true. But we're told it's likely that A is true, so ¬A scenarios are rare. In those rare ¬A scenarios, the constraint forces either B or O. Since we're told B is unlikely (because A is likely), in the ¬A scenarios, O would need to be true to satisfy the constraint.

Therefore, conditional on ¬A being true (the rare case), O is very likely to be true, making the conditional "if ¬A then O" likely to hold.

QUESTION:
Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this step by step.

Given information:
1. Spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons
2. Most vacations will likely happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer in winter
3. These are the top three seasons, so: if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will
4. Spring likely will have the most travelers, and hence summer likely won't

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?

Let me analyze statement 3 carefully: "if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will"

This can be written as: ¬Summer_most → (¬Spring_most → Winter_most)

This is logically equivalent to: (¬Summer_most ∧ ¬Spring_most) → Winter_most

Now, from statement 4, we know spring likely will have the most travelers, which means summer likely won't have the most. So it's likely that ¬Summer_most.

Given that it's likely ¬Summer_most is true, and we have the conditional (¬Summer_most ∧ ¬Spring_most) → Winter_most, we can derive:

If it's likely that ¬Summer_most, then: ¬Spring_most → Winter_most (likely holds)

This means: it's likely that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will.

This is exactly what the question asks about.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn’t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn’t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn’t lead in sales, Honda will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this step by step, using the given information:

1. Expected outcome: Ford #1, Toyota #2, Honda #3 (with Honda significantly behind)

2. Given conditional: "If Toyota isn't #1 in sales, then if Ford isn't, Honda will be"
   - This can be written as: ¬Toyota₁ → (¬Ford₁ → Honda₁)
   - Equivalently: If Toyota isn't #1, then either Ford is #1 or Honda is #1

3. Given likelihood: "Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won't"
   - Ford is likely #1
   - Toyota is likely not #1

4. Question: "Is it likely that, if Ford doesn't lead in sales, Honda will?"
   - This asks about: Likely(¬Ford₁ → Honda₁)?

Now, let's analyze:

From statement 2, we know that if Toyota isn't #1, then either Ford or Honda must be #1 (since these three lead the market).

We're told Toyota likely won't be #1. So in most scenarios, Toyota isn't #1.

Given that Toyota likely isn't #1, the conditional from statement 2 applies: if Ford isn't #1, then Honda must be #1.

The question asks whether it's likely that "if Ford doesn't lead, Honda will." 

Since we know:
- Toyota is likely not #1
- When Toyota isn't #1, the rule "if Ford isn't #1, then Honda is #1" applies
- This rule would apply in most scenarios (those where Toyota isn't #1)

Therefore, it is likely that the conditional "if Ford doesn't lead, Honda will" holds true.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this step by step.

Given information:
1. Thrillers will likely be #1, followed by romances, with mysteries far behind
2. If romances aren't #1, then if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be
3. Thrillers likely will lead sales, and hence romances likely won't be #1

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that, if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be?

Let me denote:
- T = thrillers are #1
- R = romances are #1
- M = mysteries are #1

From premise 2: ¬R → (¬T → M), which is logically equivalent to: ¬R → (T ∨ M)

From premises 1 and 3: It's likely that T (thrillers are #1), and likely that ¬R (romances aren't #1)

Now, the question asks whether: likely(¬T → M)?

From premise 2, we have: ¬R → (¬T → M)

If we know that ¬R is likely true (which we do from premise 3), then we can infer that (¬T → M) is likely true, because:
- When ¬R is true, the conditional ¬R → (¬T → M) tells us that (¬T → M) must be true
- Since ¬R is likely, (¬T → M) is likely

Therefore, it is likely that if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this step by step.

First, let me identify the key statements:
1. Tennessee likely will add the most jobs (call this T)
2. Georgia is projected second (G)
3. Missouri's growth is significantly lower (M)
4. Conditional: "If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will"
   This can be written as: ¬G → (¬T → M)
5. "Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won't"
   This suggests: T is likely, and therefore ¬G is likely

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that (¬T → M)?

Let me analyze the logical structure:
- We're given: ¬G → (¬T → M)
- This is logically equivalent to: (¬G ∧ ¬T) → M

Now, we're told Georgia likely won't add the most jobs (¬G is likely), given that Tennessee likely will.

The question is whether "if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will" is likely.

From the conditional ¬G → (¬T → M):
- If we accept that ¬G is likely true (Georgia likely won't add the most)
- Then (¬T → M) should follow from the conditional

Since we're told ¬G is likely the case (because Tennessee likely will add the most, and only one can add "the most"), and we have the conditional ¬G → (¬T → M), then by modus ponens, (¬T → M) likely holds.

Therefore, yes, it does follow that it's likely that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will.

Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this step by step.

Given information:
- Only one new law will be passed
- Three possible laws: minimum wage (MW), paid family leave (PL), student loan forgiveness (LF)
- Probability order: MW most likely > PL > LF (much less likely)
- If PL doesn't happen, then if MW doesn't happen, LF will happen
- MW likely will happen
- Therefore, PL likely won't happen (since only one law passes and MW is most likely)

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that, if MW doesn't happen, LF will?

Let me analyze the conditional: "If MW doesn't happen, then LF will happen"

From the given information:
- We know: If ~PL, then (if ~MW, then LF)
- We're told PL likely won't happen (because MW likely will happen and only one law passes)
- So ~PL is likely true

If ~PL is likely true, then the consequent "if ~MW, then LF" should hold.

Now, in the scenario where MW doesn't happen (~MW):
- We know only one law will pass
- We know these are the only three likely laws
- If ~MW and ~PL, then LF must happen (since exactly one law passes)
- We've established that ~PL is likely

So in the possible world where ~MW occurs, given that ~PL is likely, it follows that LF would happen.

Therefore, "if MW doesn't happen, LF will happen" appears to be a likely conditional, because the scenario where MW doesn't happen is one where (given PL likely won't happen) LF must be the law that passes.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this step by step.

First, let me identify the key premises:
1. Stocks likely will have the highest returns (call this S)
2. If real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will have the highest returns: ¬R → (¬S → B)
3. Stocks likely will have the highest returns, hence real estate likely won't: S, therefore likely ¬R

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will? In other words: Is "likely (¬S → B)" a consequence?

Let me analyze this:

From premise 3, we have that it's likely that ¬R (real estate likely won't have the highest returns).

From premise 2, we have: ¬R → (¬S → B)

Now, if we know that ¬R is likely true, and we have the conditional ¬R → (¬S → B), then by modus ponens, we can derive that (¬S → B) is likely true.

In other words:
- Likely ¬R (from premise 3)
- ¬R → (¬S → B) (from premise 2)
- Therefore, likely (¬S → B)

This is exactly what the question is asking about. The reasoning is valid: if it's likely that real estate won't have the highest returns, and we know that if real estate doesn't have the highest returns then (if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will), then it follows that it's likely that if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this step by step, using the logical structure provided.

Given information:
1. Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the only major transportation providers
2. Uber likely will have the most rides (most probable)
3. Lyft is second most likely
4. Taxis have significantly fewer rides (least likely)
5. Key conditional: "If Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides"
6. Since Uber likely gives the most rides, Lyft likely won't give the most rides

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that "if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will"?

Let me parse the conditional in statement 5:
- If ¬Lyft_most → (If ¬Uber_most → Taxis_most)
- This is logically equivalent to: (¬Lyft_most ∧ ¬Uber_most) → Taxis_most

From statement 6, we know Lyft likely won't give the most rides (¬Lyft_most is likely true).

Now, given that ¬Lyft_most is likely true, the conditional simplifies:
- If ¬Lyft_most is true, then: ¬Uber_most → Taxis_most

So the question becomes: Is it likely that (¬Uber_most → Taxis_most)?

Since we're told ¬Lyft_most is likely true, and we have the conditional (¬Lyft_most ∧ ¬Uber_most) → Taxis_most, this means that in the likely scenario where Lyft doesn't give the most rides, IF Uber also doesn't give the most rides, THEN taxis must give the most rides (since these are the only three options).

Therefore, it is likely that the conditional "if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will" holds true.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this step by step using the given information.

Given premises:
1. Flu, cold, and strep are the only major illnesses
2. Flu is expected to infect the most (flu is likely)
3. If colds don't infect the most, then if flu doesn't, strep will: ¬Cold → (¬Flu → Strep)
4. Flu likely will infect the most, and hence colds likely won't: Likely(Flu) and Likely(¬Cold)

Question: Does it follow that Likely(¬Flu → Strep)?

From premise 3, we have a conditional: ¬Cold → (¬Flu → Strep)
This is equivalent to: ¬Cold → (Flu ∨ Strep)

From premise 4, we know Likely(¬Cold).

Now, the key question is whether we can infer from:
- Likely(¬Cold), and
- ¬Cold → (¬Flu → Strep)

that Likely(¬Flu → Strep)?

Since we're told it's likely that colds won't infect the most (Likely(¬Cold)), and we have the conditional that if colds don't infect the most, then if flu doesn't, strep will (¬Cold → (¬Flu → Strep)), we can reason as follows:

In the likely scenario where ¬Cold holds, the conditional (¬Flu → Strep) must hold (by modus ponens on the material conditional). Therefore, in likely scenarios, we have (¬Flu → Strep).

This means: Likely(¬Flu → Strep).

QUESTION:
Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:

Let me work through this step by step, using the given information:

Given premises:
1. Pizza likely will be the top takeout item (P is likely)
2. If burgers aren't top, then if pizza isn't top, tacos will be: ¬B → (¬P → T)
3. Pizza likely will lead, and hence burgers likely won't: P is likely, therefore ¬B is likely

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that (if pizza isn't top, tacos will be)? 
In other words: Is (¬P → T) likely?

Let me analyze this:

From premise 2: ¬B → (¬P → T)
This means: If burgers aren't top, then (if pizza isn't top, tacos will be)

From premise 3: ¬B is likely (burgers likely won't be top)

Now, if ¬B is likely true, and we have ¬B → (¬P → T), then by modus ponens reasoning with likelihoods, we can infer that (¬P → T) is likely.

This is because:
- We're told burgers likely won't be top (¬B is likely)
- We're told that if burgers aren't top, then the conditional (¬P → T) holds
- Therefore, the conditional (¬P → T) likely holds

The reasoning is valid: if it's likely that ¬B, and ¬B guarantees (¬P → T), then (¬P → T) is likely.

QUESTION:
Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this step by step using the given information.

Given premises:
1. Rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less
2. If home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most
3. Rents likely will increase the most
4. Hence home prices likely won't increase the most

Let me denote:
- R = rents increase the most
- H = home prices increase the most
- M = mortgage rates increase the most

From premise 1 and 3: R is likely true
From premise 4: H is likely false (which follows from R being likely true, since only one can increase "the most")

Premise 2 states: ¬H → (¬R → M)

Now, the question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that (¬R → M)?

Since we're told that H likely won't increase the most (¬H is likely), and we have the conditional ¬H → (¬R → M), we can derive that (¬R → M) is likely true.

This is because:
- We're told ¬H is likely true
- We have ¬H → (¬R → M)
- By modus ponens applied to likely statements, if ¬H is likely and ¬H → (¬R → M), then (¬R → M) is likely

Therefore, yes, it does follow that it's likely that if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.

QUESTION:
Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this step by step using logical notation.

Let me define:
- C = coffee retains the most morning drinkers
- T = tea retains the most morning drinkers  
- S = soda retains the most morning drinkers

From the passage, I can extract these premises:

1. "These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers."
   This gives us: ¬T → (¬C → S)

2. "Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers"
   This gives us: likely(C)

3. "and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers"
   This gives us: likely(¬T)

The question asks: Does it follow that likely(¬C → S)?

From premise 1: ¬T → (¬C → S)
From premise 3: likely(¬T)

Now, if we have ¬T → (¬C → S), and we know that ¬T is likely true, then we can reasonably infer that (¬C → S) is likely true.

This is because:
- We have a conditional: ¬T → (¬C → S)
- We have that the antecedent is likely: likely(¬T)
- Therefore, the consequent should also be likely: likely(¬C → S)

This follows a pattern of reasoning where if "if P then Q" is true, and P is likely, then Q is likely.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this step by step using the given information.

Given facts:
1. Democrats likely will gain the most new voters (call this D)
2. Republicans are second most likely (R)
3. Libertarians trail distantly (L)
4. Conditional: If Republicans don't gain the most voters, then if Democrats don't, Libertarians will. In logical form: ¬R → (¬D → L)
5. Democrats likely will gain the most voters, so Republicans likely won't (D is likely, so ¬R is likely)

The question asks: Does it follow that it is likely that (if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will)? In other words, is (¬D → L) likely?

From fact 4, we have: ¬R → (¬D → L)

This means: If Republicans don't gain the most voters, then the conditional (¬D → L) holds.

From fact 5, we know that ¬R is likely (Republicans likely won't gain the most voters).

Now, if ¬R is likely true, and we have ¬R → (¬D → L), then by modus ponens, (¬D → L) is likely true.

In other words: Since it's likely that Republicans won't gain the most voters, and we know that if Republicans don't gain the most voters then "if Democrats don't gain the most, Libertarians will," it follows that it's likely that "if Democrats don't gain the most, Libertarians will."

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this step by step using the given information.

Given facts:
1. Taylor Swift (T), Bad Bunny (B), and Beyonce (Be) have the only top-selling albums
2. It's likely T will sell the most, followed closely by B, with Be far behind
3. If B doesn't sell the most, then if T doesn't sell the most, Be will (¬B → (¬T → Be))
4. It's likely T will sell the most, and hence B likely won't

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that (if T doesn't sell the most, Be will)?

Let me analyze the conditional: "If T doesn't sell the most, then Be will"

From fact 3, we have: ¬B → (¬T → Be)
This is logically equivalent to: (¬B ∧ ¬T) → Be

Now, we're told it's likely that T will sell the most. This means it's unlikely that T won't sell the most (¬T is unlikely).

However, the question asks about the likelihood of the conditional "if ¬T, then Be."

In the scenario where T doesn't sell the most (which is described as unlikely), we need to determine what happens. Given that only T, B, or Be can sell the most, if T doesn't, then either B or Be must.

From fact 3: If B doesn't sell the most, then (if T doesn't, Be will).
Since one of them must sell the most, and we're considering the case where T doesn't, then either B or Be does.

The conditional "if T doesn't sell the most, then Be will" would be false only if T doesn't sell the most AND Be doesn't sell the most - which would mean B sells the most.

But we're told B is unlikely to sell the most. So in the unlikely scenario where T doesn't sell the most, it's unlikely to be B, which means it would likely be Be.

Therefore, the conditional "if T doesn't, Be will" is likely true.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this step by step.

Given information:
1. India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies (and by far the biggest)
2. Economists project India will likely grow fastest, followed by China, with Russia lagging far behind
3. "If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn't, Russia will be"
4. India's economy likely will grow the fastest, hence China's likely won't

The question asks: Does it follow that it's likely that "if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be"?

Let me analyze the conditional in statement 3: "If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn't, Russia will be."

This can be written as: ¬China_top → (¬India_top → Russia_top)

Now, we're told it's likely that India will be the top-growing economy. This means it's likely that China won't be top (statement 4 confirms this).

So it's likely that ¬China_top is true.

Given that ¬China_top is likely true, and we have the conditional ¬China_top → (¬India_top → Russia_top), we can derive that it's likely that (¬India_top → Russia_top).

This is exactly what the question asks about: "if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be."

Since these are the only three major emerging economies mentioned, and we're told they are "by far the biggest," one of them must be the top-growing emerging economy. The conditional logic combined with the likelihood that China won't be top means that the conditional "if India isn't top, Russia will be" is likely true.

QUESTION:
Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: The question asks whether it follows that it is likely that if spring does not have the most vacations, then winter will. The given information states that spring, summer, and winter are the top travel seasons, and forecasts indicate it is likely that spring has the most vacations, followed closely by summer, with many fewer in winter. Additionally, it is stated that if summer does not have the most vacations, then if spring does not, winter will, and that spring likely has the most travelers, so summer likely does not.

The key point is the logical relationship: from the fact that these are the top seasons, it follows that if summer does not have the most vacations, then if spring does not, winter will. This can be expressed as ¬U → (¬S → W), where S, U, and W represent spring, summer, and winter having the most vacations, respectively. This implication is always true under the given conditions because no other season can have the most vacations.

Moreover, since spring likely has the most vacations (P(S) is high), and summer likely does not (P(¬U) is high), the probability that ¬U is true is high. When ¬U is true, the implication ¬U → (¬S → W) means that ¬S → W is true. Therefore, with high probability, ¬S → W is true.

The probability of the conditional "if ¬S then W" is equivalent to P(S ∨ W), since ¬S → W is logically equivalent to S ∨ W. Given that P(S) is high and P(W) is low but positive, P(S ∨ W) = P(S) + P(W) is high because P(S) dominates. Thus, it is likely that if spring does not have the most vacations, winter will.

While the conditional probability P(W | ¬S) might not be high due to the significant probability of summer having the most when spring does not, the question is about the likelihood of the conditional statement itself, not the conditional probability. Based on the logical derivation and the high probability of S ∨ W, it follows that the conditional is likely.

These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: The argument involves three housing costs: rents (R), home prices (H), and mortgage rates (M), with only one expected to increase the most. The economists project that R is likely true (rents increase the most), which implies that H is unlikely (home prices won't increase the most). The given conditional statement, "if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most," is logically equivalent to ¬H → (¬R → M). This can be rewritten as (¬H ∧ ¬R) → M, which is necessarily true because there are only three costs, so if neither H nor R is the most, M must be the most.

The question asks whether it is likely that ¬R → M (if rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most). Logically, ¬R → M is equivalent to R ∨ M, meaning it is true if either R is true or M is true. Since R is likely true (as projected), the probability of R ∨ M is high because P(R ∨ M) ≥ P(R). Therefore, ¬R → M is likely true, as the only scenario where it is false is when ¬R and ¬M are both true, which corresponds to H being true. However, H is unlikely because R is likely, so P(¬R ∧ ¬M) = P(H) is low. Thus, the probability that ¬R → M is true is high.

These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny’s album doesn’t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift’s doesn’t, Beyonce’s will.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: The reasoning involves understanding the logical relationships and probabilities given in the scenario. First, the statement "if Bad Bunny’s album doesn’t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift’s doesn’t, Beyonce’s will" is always true because there are only three top-selling albums, so exactly one must be the top-seller. This means that if Bad Bunny is not the top-seller, then either Taylor Swift or Beyonce must be, and if Taylor Swift is not, then Beyonce must be. Logically, "if not M_T then M_Y" is equivalent to "not M_B" because if Bad Bunny is not the top-seller, then Taylor Swift or Beyonce is, and if Taylor Swift is not, Beyonce is; conversely, if "if not M_T then M_Y" is true, then Bad Bunny cannot be the top-seller (since if Bad Bunny were the top-seller, then not M_T and not M_Y would make the conditional false).

The premises also state that Taylor Swift is likely to sell the most (P(M_T) is high), and hence Bad Bunny is likely not to sell the most (P(not M_B) is high). Since "if not M_T then M_Y" is equivalent to "not M_B", and P(not M_B) is high, it follows that P(if not M_T then M_Y) is high. This means the material conditional "if Taylor Swift doesn't sell the most, then Beyonce will" is likely true. While Beyonce's album is far behind, the high probability of Taylor Swift selling the most ensures that the conditional is likely true, as the conditional holds whenever Taylor Swift sells the most or Beyonce does, and Taylor Swift selling the most is likely.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: The scenario involves India, China, and Russia as the top three emerging economies, with only one able to be the top-growing economy. The economists project that it is likely India's economy will grow the fastest, implying a high probability for India being top (P(I) is high). Consequently, China is unlikely to be top (P(C) is low). The conditional statement "if China is not the top-growing, then if India isn’t, Russia will be" is logically equivalent to ¬C → (¬I → R), which simplifies to ¬C → (I ∨ R). However, given that only one economy can be top, ¬I → R is equivalent to I ∨ R, and P(I ∨ R) = P(I) + P(R) since I and R are mutually exclusive. Although P(R) is low due to Russia's growth lagging distantly behind, P(I) is high, so P(I ∨ R) is high. Alternatively, P(¬I → R) = P(I ∨ R) = 1 - P(C), and since P(C) is low, P(¬I → R) is high. Therefore, it is likely that if India is not the top-growing economy, Russia will be.

QUESTION:
Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the information:

*   **Premise 1:** Spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons.
*   **Premise 2:** Forecasts show spring will likely have the most vacations, followed closely by summer, with winter having many fewer.
*   **Premise 3:** These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will.
*   **Premise 4:** Spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't.

We want to determine if the following statement is true: "If spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will."

Premise 3 states: "if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will."

The question asks if "if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will" is true.

Premise 3 is a conditional statement. Let's analyze it.

Let A = "summer doesn't have the most vacations"
Let B = "spring doesn't have the most vacations"
Let C = "winter will have the most vacations"

Premise 3 can be written as: If A, then (if B, then C).

The question asks if "if B, then C" is true.

Premise 4 states that spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. This means A is likely true.

If A is true, then "if B, then C" is true *only if* A is always true. However, we only know that A is *likely* true. It is possible that summer *does* have the most vacations.

If summer *does* have the most vacations, then A is false. If A is false, then the conditional statement "If A, then (if B, then C)" is true regardless of the truth values of B and C.

However, we are trying to determine if "if B, then C" is true.

Premise 3 states that "if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will." This is the only information we have that relates the lack of spring having the most vacations to winter having the most vacations.

Therefore, if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that thrillers, romances, and mysteries are the top-selling fiction genres. Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren’t #1, then if thrillers aren’t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if thrillers aren’t #1, mysteries will be?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the information:

*   **Premise 1:** Thrillers, romances, and mysteries are the top-selling genres.
*   **Premise 2:** Thrillers are likely #1, romances are likely #2, mysteries are far behind.
*   **Premise 3:** If romances aren't #1, then if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be #1.
*   **Premise 4:** Thrillers likely will lead sales, hence romances likely won't.

We want to determine if it's likely that *if* thrillers aren't #1, *then* mysteries will be #1.

Premise 3 states: "If romances aren't #1, then if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be #1."

Let's analyze this conditional statement. The antecedent is "romances aren't #1". The consequent is "if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be #1".

We are given that thrillers are *likely* to be #1. So, let's consider the scenario where thrillers are *not* #1.

If thrillers are not #1, then either romances or mysteries are #1.

*   **Case 1: Romances are #1.** In this case, the antecedent of Premise 3 ("romances aren't #1") is false. Therefore, the entire conditional statement (Premise 3) is true, regardless of whether mysteries are #1. However, we are interested in the case where thrillers are not #1.

*   **Case 2: Romances are not #1.** In this case, the antecedent of Premise 3 ("romances aren't #1") is true. Therefore, the consequent must also be true: "if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be #1". Since we are considering the scenario where thrillers are not #1, it follows that mysteries will be #1.

Premise 2 states that romances are likely #2 and mysteries are far behind. Premise 4 states that thrillers likely will lead sales, hence romances likely won't. This suggests that romances are unlikely to be #1.

Therefore, it is likely that romances are not #1. If romances are not #1, then if thrillers are not #1, mysteries will be #1.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the given information:

*   **Premise 1:** Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth.
*   **Premise 2:** Tennessee > Georgia > Missouri (in terms of job growth). This means Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs, followed by Georgia, and then Missouri.
*   **Premise 3:** If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will. This can be written as: ¬Georgia → (¬Tennessee → Missouri).
*   **Premise 4:** Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, and hence Georgia likely won't. This can be written as: Tennessee → ¬Georgia.

We want to determine if it follows that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will. This can be written as: ¬Tennessee → Missouri.

Let's analyze the premises. Premise 2 states that Tennessee > Georgia > Missouri. This means Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs. Therefore, ¬Tennessee is false.

Premise 3 states: ¬Georgia → (¬Tennessee → Missouri).
Premise 4 states: Tennessee → ¬Georgia.

We want to prove ¬Tennessee → Missouri.

Since we know from Premise 2 that Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs, ¬Tennessee is false. Therefore, we are trying to prove something based on a false premise.

If Tennessee does not add the most jobs (¬Tennessee), then according to Premise 3, if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs (¬Georgia), then Missouri will (Missouri). However, we know from Premise 2 that Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs, so ¬Tennessee is false.

Since Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs, ¬Tennessee is false. Therefore, the statement ¬Tennessee → Missouri is false.

However, the question asks if it *follows* that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will. Since we know Tennessee *will* add the most jobs, the premise "Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs" is false. Any statement that starts with a false premise is considered true in logic.

QUESTION:
Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the information:

*   **Possible Laws:** Minimum Wage Hike (MW), Paid Family Leave (PL), Student Loan Forgiveness (LF)
*   **Probabilities:** MW > PL > LF (MW is most likely, LF is least likely)
*   **Only One Law:** Only one of these laws will pass.
*   **Conditional Statement 1:** If PL doesn't happen, then if MW doesn't happen, LF will happen.  This can be written as:  ¬PL -> (¬MW -> LF)
*   **Conditional Statement 2:** MW likely will happen, and hence PL likely won't happen. This can be written as: MW is likely, and ¬PL is likely.

We want to determine if it's likely that, if MW doesn't happen, LF will happen.  This can be written as: ¬MW -> LF.

From Conditional Statement 1: ¬PL -> (¬MW -> LF). Since ¬PL is likely (from Conditional Statement 2), it's likely that (¬MW -> LF).

Therefore, it is likely that if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the given information:

*   **Premise 1:** Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options.
*   **Premise 2:** Uber likely has the most rides, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer.
*   **Premise 3:** If Lyft doesn't have the most rides, then if Uber doesn't have the most rides, taxis will have the most rides.
*   **Premise 4:** Uber likely has the most rides, and therefore Lyft likely doesn't have the most rides.

We want to determine if it follows that "if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will."

From Premise 4, we know Uber *likely* has the most rides. However, we are asked to consider the scenario where Uber *doesn't* have the most rides.

Premise 3 states: If Lyft doesn't have the most rides, then if Uber doesn't have the most rides, taxis will have the most rides.

Premise 4 tells us that Lyft likely doesn't have the most rides. So, we can assume that Lyft doesn't have the most rides.

Therefore, the first part of Premise 3 is satisfied. So, the second part of Premise 3 must be true: if Uber doesn't have the most rides, taxis will have the most rides.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the information provided:

*   **Illnesses:** Flu, Common Cold, Strep Throat
*   **Prevalence Expectation:** Flu > Common Cold > Strep Throat (where ">" means "infects more people than")
*   **Only Major Illnesses:** These are the only significant illnesses spreading.
*   **Conditional 1:** If Colds don't infect the most, then if Flu doesn't infect the most, Strep will. (¬C → (¬F → S))
*   **Conditional 2:** Flu likely will infect the most, and hence Colds likely won't. (F ∧ ¬C)

We want to determine if it follows that if Flu doesn't infect the most, Strep will. (¬F → S)

From Conditional 1: ¬C → (¬F → S)
From Conditional 2: F ∧ ¬C

Since ¬C is true (from Conditional 2), then ¬C → (¬F → S) simplifies to ¬F → S.

Therefore, if Flu doesn't infect the most, Strep will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the information provided:

*   **Premise 1:** Pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods.
*   **Premise 2:** Pizza is likely the top takeout item, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently.
*   **Premise 3:** If burgers aren't the top takeout item, then if pizza isn't, tacos will be.
*   **Premise 4:** Pizza likely will lead takeout orders, and hence burgers likely won't.

We want to determine if the following conclusion is likely to be true: If pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be.

Let's analyze the premises. Premise 2 states that pizza is *likely* the top item. Premise 3 is a conditional statement: "If burgers aren't the top, then if pizza isn't, tacos will be." Premise 4 reinforces that pizza is *likely* the top item, implying burgers are *likely* not the top item.

The question asks if "if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be" is likely.

Let's consider the case where pizza isn't the top item. According to premise 1, the top item must be either burgers or tacos.

If burgers are the top item, then the condition "burgers aren't the top" in premise 3 is false. Therefore, the entire conditional statement in premise 3 is true, regardless of whether "if pizza isn't, tacos will be" is true or false.

If tacos are the top item, then pizza isn't the top item, and tacos *are* the top item. So, the statement "if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be" is true.

However, premise 2 states that pizza is *likely* the top item, and burgers are *likely* second. Tacos are ordered much less frequently. So, if pizza isn't the top item, it's *more likely* that burgers are the top item than tacos.

Premise 3 states "If burgers aren't the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn't, tacos will be." If pizza isn't the top item, and burgers *are* the top item, then the condition "burgers aren't the top" is false, so the entire statement is true.

If pizza isn't the top item, and burgers aren't the top item, then tacos *must* be the top item.

Since pizza is *likely* the top item, it's *unlikely* that pizza isn't the top item. If pizza isn't the top item, it's *more likely* that burgers are the top item than tacos. However, if burgers are the top item, then the statement "if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be" is still true.

Therefore, it is likely that if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be.

Explanation:
Let's break down the information provided:

*   **Premise 1:** Rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase.
*   **Premise 2:** Rents are projected to increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less.
*   **Premise 3:** These are the *only* major housing costs expected to rise substantially.
*   **Premise 4:** If home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.
*   **Premise 5:** Rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most.

We want to determine if the following statement is true: "If rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most."

From Premise 2 and 5, we know that rents *do* increase the most. Therefore, the condition "rents don't increase the most" is false.

In logic, an "if...then" statement is only false when the "if" part is true and the "then" part is false. If the "if" part is false, the entire statement is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the "then" part.

Since the "if" part ("rents don't increase the most") is false, the statement "If rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most" is true.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the information:

*   **Top Contenders:** Lakers, Warriors, Celtics
*   **Odds:** Lakers > Warriors >> Celtics (Lakers most likely, Warriors close second, Celtics much lower)
*   **Rule:** If Warriors don't win, then if Lakers don't win, Celtics win. (W' -> (L' -> C))

We want to determine if "If Lakers don't win, Celtics will win" is likely (L' -> C).

We know that if the Warriors don't win, and the Lakers don't win, then the Celtics win. (W' -> (L' -> C)). Since W' is likely, then (L' -> C) is likely.

Therefore, it is likely that if the Lakers don't win, the Celtics will win.

Explanation:
Let's break down the argument:

*   **Premise 1:** Coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages.
*   **Premise 2:** Coffee likely retains the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less.
*   **Premise 3:** If tea doesn't retain the most, then if coffee doesn't retain the most, soda will retain the most.

These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren’t the top seller, then if banana bread isn’t, carrot cake will be.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the information provided:

*   **Popularity:** Banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the top sellers.
*   **Likely Scenario:** Banana bread is likely the top seller, followed by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind.
*   **Rule 1:** If chocolate chip cookies aren't the top seller, then if banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake will be.
*   **Rule 2:** It is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won’t be.

We want to determine if it's likely that *if* banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake *will* be.

Let's consider the cases where banana bread isn't the top seller:

1.  **Chocolate Chip Cookies are Top Seller:** In this case, Rule 1 doesn't directly apply because the condition "chocolate chip cookies aren't the top seller" is false.
2.  **Carrot Cake is Top Seller:** In this case, Rule 1 applies. Since chocolate chip cookies aren't the top seller, and banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake *is* the top seller (which is consistent).

Rule 2 states that it's *likely* banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won’t be. This suggests that the scenario where chocolate chip cookies are the top seller is less likely.

However, the question asks if it's *likely* that *if* banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake *will* be. Rule 1 states that *if* chocolate chip cookies aren't the top seller, *then if* banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake *will* be.

If banana bread isn't the top seller, then either chocolate chip cookies or carrot cake is. If chocolate chip cookies are the top seller, then the statement "if banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake will be" is false. If carrot cake is the top seller, then the statement "if banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake will be" is true.

Since it is likely that banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won’t be, it is likely that if banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake will be.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the given information:

*   **Premise 1:** Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading parties.
*   **Premise 2:** Democrats likely gain the most voters, then Republicans, then Libertarians.
*   **Premise 3:** These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will.
*   **Premise 4:** Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won’t.

We want to determine if it follows that "it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will."

Premise 2 states the *likely* order of voter gain: Democrats > Republicans > Libertarians. Premise 4 reinforces this by stating Democrats *likely* will gain the most voters, and therefore Republicans *likely* won't.

Premise 3 is a conditional statement: "If Republicans don't gain the most voters, then if Democrats don't, Libertarians will." This can be written as:

¬R -> (¬D -> L)

Where:
*   R = Republicans gain the most voters
*   D = Democrats gain the most voters
*   L = Libertarians gain the most voters

We are asked if it is likely that (¬D -> L).

From Premise 4, we know that D is likely true and R is likely false (¬R is likely true).

Let's consider the case where Democrats *don't* gain the most voters (¬D). If ¬D is true, then either Republicans or Libertarians gain the most voters.

If Republicans gain the most voters (R), then the antecedent of Premise 3 (¬R) is false, so the conditional (¬R -> (¬D -> L)) is true regardless of the truth value of (¬D -> L).

If Republicans don't gain the most voters (¬R), then the antecedent of Premise 3 is true. Therefore, the consequent (¬D -> L) must also be true. This means that *if* Democrats don't gain the most voters (¬D), then Libertarians *will* gain the most voters (L).

Since Premise 3 states that *if* Republicans don't gain the most voters, *then* if Democrats don't, Libertarians will, and we know from Premise 4 that Republicans likely won't gain the most voters, it follows that if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny’s album doesn’t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift’s doesn’t, Beyonce’s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift’s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the statements:

*   **Statement 1:** Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums.
*   **Statement 2:** Taylor Swift's album is *likely* to sell the most, followed by Bad Bunny, with Beyonce far behind.
*   **Statement 3:** If Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most, then if Taylor Swift's doesn't, Beyonce's will.
*   **Statement 4:** Taylor Swift's *likely* will sell the most, and hence Bad Bunny's *likely* won't.

We want to determine if it follows that it's *likely* that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will.

Statement 4 tells us that Taylor Swift is *likely* to sell the most. This means there's a high probability of Taylor Swift selling the most. However, it doesn't mean it's *impossible* for her not to.

Let's consider the scenario where Taylor Swift *doesn't* sell the most. Statement 3 says: "If Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most, then if Taylor Swift's doesn't, Beyonce's will."

Since we are considering the case where Taylor Swift doesn't sell the most, we need to consider whether Bad Bunny sells the most. Statement 4 says that Bad Bunny *likely* won't sell the most. However, it is possible that Bad Bunny sells the most.

If Bad Bunny sells the most, then the condition "Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most" in Statement 3 is false. Therefore, the entire "if...then" statement in Statement 3 is true, regardless of whether Beyonce sells the most.

If Bad Bunny doesn't sell the most, then the condition "Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most" in Statement 3 is true. In this case, the "if Taylor Swift's doesn't, Beyonce's will" part of Statement 3 must also be true.

Statement 2 tells us that Taylor Swift is *likely* to sell the most, followed by Bad Bunny, with Beyonce far behind. This means that if Taylor Swift doesn't sell the most, it's *more likely* that Bad Bunny will sell the most than Beyonce.

However, Statement 3 *guarantees* that if Bad Bunny doesn't sell the most and Taylor Swift doesn't sell the most, then Beyonce *will* sell the most.

Since Statement 4 says that Taylor Swift is *likely* to sell the most, it is *unlikely* that Taylor Swift doesn't sell the most. If Taylor Swift doesn't sell the most, then it is *likely* that Bad Bunny will sell the most. However, if Bad Bunny doesn't sell the most, then Beyonce *will* sell the most.

Therefore, it is *likely* that if Taylor Swift doesn't sell the most, Beyonce will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it’s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the argument:

*   **Premise 1:** Tidal, solar, and wind are the leading renewable energy sources.
*   **Premise 2:** Tidal is likely to generate the most electricity, followed by solar, with wind lagging.
*   **Premise 3:** If solar doesn't generate the most, then if tidal doesn't, wind will.
*   **Premise 4:** Tidal likely will generate the most, and hence solar likely won't.

We want to determine if it follows that: If tidal doesn't generate the most electricity, wind will.

From Premise 2 and 4, we know that tidal is *likely* to generate the most electricity. However, the question asks what happens *if* tidal *doesn't* generate the most.

Premise 3 states: "If solar doesn't generate the most electricity, then if tidal doesn't, wind will."

Premise 4 states: "Tidal likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar likely won't."

So, we know that solar likely won't generate the most electricity. Therefore, the first part of the conditional in Premise 3, "If solar doesn't generate the most electricity," is likely true.

Now, we are considering the scenario where tidal doesn't generate the most electricity. In this scenario, the second part of the conditional in Premise 3, "then if tidal doesn't, wind will," becomes relevant.

Since solar likely won't generate the most electricity, and we are considering the case where tidal doesn't generate the most electricity, then according to Premise 3, wind will generate the most electricity.

QUESTION:
Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the argument step by step.

1. **Premise 1:** Spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons.
2. **Premise 2:** It's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer in winter.
3. **Premise 3:** If summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will.
4. **Premise 4:** Spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer won't.

We want to determine if it follows that "if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will."

Let's use symbols to represent the statements:

*   S = Spring has the most vacations.
*   U = Summer has the most vacations.
*   W = Winter has the most vacations.

Premise 2 can be rephrased as: S is most likely, U is second most likely, and W is least likely.
Premise 4 states that S is likely to have the most travelers, therefore U is not.

Premise 3 can be written as: If not U, then (if not S, then W).

We are given that spring likely will have the most travelers, so S is likely true. Therefore, it's unlikely that spring *doesn't* have the most vacations. The question asks us to consider the scenario where spring *doesn't* have the most vacations. If spring doesn't have the most vacations, then according to premise 3, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Since spring is likely to have the most vacations, the condition "if spring doesn't" is unlikely to be true. However, we are asked to assume that spring doesn't have the most vacations.

If spring doesn't have the most vacations, then, according to premise 3, if spring doesn't, winter will. This means that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn’t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn’t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn’t lead in sales, Honda will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements and analyze the logic.

1. **Premise 1:** Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. This establishes an initial expectation of Ford > Toyota >> Honda in sales.

2. **Premise 2:** If Toyota isn’t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn’t, Honda will be. This is a conditional statement:  If (Toyota is not #1) then (If Ford is not #1, then Honda is #1).  We can represent this as:  ¬Toyota #1 → (¬Ford #1 → Honda #1).

3. **Premise 3:** Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota won’t. This means Ford is likely #1 and Toyota is likely not #1.

We want to determine if it follows that if Ford doesn’t lead in sales, Honda will.  In other words, we want to know if ¬Ford #1 → Honda #1 is a logical consequence of the premises.

Let's analyze. Premise 3 tells us Ford is *likely* to lead. This doesn't guarantee it.  If Ford *doesn't* lead (¬Ford #1), then we need to consider Premise 2. Premise 2 states that *if* Toyota isn't #1, *then* if Ford isn't #1, Honda will be. Since we're assuming Ford isn't #1 (¬Ford #1), we need to see if Toyota is not #1. Premise 3 states that Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota won’t. This means Toyota is likely not #1. Therefore, the condition in Premise 2 is met.  Since Toyota is likely not #1, and Ford isn't #1, then according to Premise 2, Honda will be #1.

Therefore, if Ford doesn't lead in sales, it logically follows that Honda will.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the given information and the question step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:** Thrillers, romances, and mysteries are the top-selling fiction genres.
2. **Prediction 1:** Thrillers are likely to be #1 this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind.
3. **Conditional Statement:** "If romances aren’t #1, then if thrillers aren’t, mysteries will be." This is a nested conditional. Let's represent it symbolically:
   * R = Romances are #1
   * T = Thrillers are #1
   * M = Mysteries are #1
   The statement becomes:  ¬R → (¬T → M)
4. **Prediction 2:** Thrillers likely will lead sales, so romances likely won’t. This translates to: T is likely, ¬R is likely.
5. **Question:** Does it follow that, if thrillers aren’t #1, mysteries will be? This translates to: ¬T → M.

Now let's analyze. We know ¬R is likely.  Let's assume ¬T is true (thrillers aren't #1).  We need to determine if M must be true.

From the conditional statement ¬R → (¬T → M), since ¬R is likely true, then (¬T → M) is likely true.  We are given that ¬T is assumed to be true. Therefore, since (¬T → M) is likely true and ¬T is true, then M must be true.

Therefore, if thrillers aren't #1, it follows that mysteries will be.

Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the given information and analyze the logical flow.

1. **Possible Laws:** We have three potential laws: Minimum Wage Hike (MW), Paid Family Leave (PL), and Student Loan Forgiveness (LF). Only one will pass.

2. **Probabilities:** MW is most probable, followed by PL, and LF is least probable.

3. **Conditional Statement 1:** "If paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen."  This can be written as:  ¬PL → (¬MW → LF)

4. **Statement 2:** "A minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen." This can be written as: MW and ¬PL.

We want to determine if it follows that "if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen."  This is: ¬MW → LF.

Let's analyze. We know MW is likely, so ¬MW is unlikely.  However, we need to see if ¬MW *implies* LF, given the other statements.

From statement 2, we know ¬PL is likely.  Let's substitute this into statement 1:

¬PL → (¬MW → LF) becomes True → (¬MW → LF) because ¬PL is likely true.  This simplifies to ¬MW → LF.

Since we're given that a minimum wage hike likely will happen, it's unlikely that a minimum wage hike won't happen. However, the conditional statement ¬MW → LF is still valid based on the given information. The likelihood of MW happening doesn't invalidate the conditional statement.

Therefore, based on the given information, it *does* follow that if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the argument step by step using logical notation to clarify the relationships.

*   **Premise 1:** Stock market returns > Real estate market returns > Bond market returns (likely)
*   **Premise 2:** If real estate market returns are not the highest, then if stocks are not the highest, bonds will be. (If ¬Real Estate > Stocks, then if ¬Stocks > Bonds, then Bonds)
*   **Premise 3:** Stocks likely will have the highest returns.
*   **Premise 4:** If stocks have the highest returns, then real estate won't.

We want to determine if it follows that "if stocks don’t have the highest returns, then bonds will."

Let's represent the statements as follows:

*   S = Stocks have the highest returns
*   R = Real estate has the highest returns
*   B = Bonds have the highest returns

The premises can be written as:

1.  S > R > B (likely)
2.  ¬R → (¬S → B)
3.  S (likely)
4.  S → ¬R

From premise 3 (S), we know stocks are likely to have the highest returns. From premise 4 (S → ¬R), we know that if stocks have the highest returns, then real estate won't.  Since we are given that stocks *likely* will have the highest returns, it's reasonable to assume that real estate won't.

Now, let's consider the conditional statement in premise 2: ¬R → (¬S → B). We want to know if ¬S → B follows.

Since we are given that S is likely, ¬S is unlikely.  However, let's assume, for the sake of argument, that ¬S is true.  If ¬S is true, then from premise 2, we have ¬R → B.  Since premise 4 (S → ¬R) is true, and we are assuming ¬S, then we can't directly conclude anything about R. However, the initial premise states that stocks likely will have the highest returns. If that's not the case, then the initial premise is false.

Let's re-examine premise 2: "If real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will." This is a nested conditional. Let's rewrite it as: ¬R → (¬S → B). We are given that stocks likely will have the highest returns. Therefore, it is unlikely that stocks won't have the highest returns. However, let's assume that stocks don't have the highest returns. Then, according to premise 2, if real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then bonds will.

Since we are given that stocks likely will have the highest returns, it is unlikely that stocks won't. However, if we assume that stocks don't have the highest returns, then we can apply premise 2.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the argument step by step.

1. **Premise 1:** Uber likely will have the most rides, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. This establishes an initial ranking: Uber > Lyft > Taxis (where ">" means "more rides than").

2. **Premise 2:** If Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. This is a conditional statement: (Lyft doesn't give the most rides) -> ((Uber doesn't give the most rides) -> (Taxis give the most rides)).

3. **Premise 3:** Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. This combines two statements: (Uber gives the most rides) AND (Lyft doesn’t give the most rides).

We want to determine if it follows that if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will. This is asking us to evaluate the statement: (Uber doesn’t give the most rides) -> (Taxis give the most rides).

Let's analyze this using the given premises. Premise 3 tells us Uber *likely* will give the most rides. This means it's possible, though not certain, that Uber *doesn't* give the most rides. If Uber doesn't give the most rides, then, according to premise 2, we need to consider what happens if Lyft doesn't give the most rides. However, premise 3 states that Lyft *doesn't* give the most rides. Therefore, we can apply the second part of premise 2: if Uber doesn't give the most rides, then taxis will.

Therefore, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will.

ERROR #8 (Question 17)

QUESTION:
Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements and analyze the logic.

1. **Premise 1:** Flu > Cold > Strep (in terms of prevalence - flu infects the most, then cold, then strep). This is stated as "the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind."

2. **Premise 2:** If colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will. This is a conditional statement: If NOT Cold > Most, then (If NOT Flu > Most, then Strep > Most).

3. **Premise 3:** Flu likely will infect the most. This implies that colds likely won't.

We want to determine if it follows that "if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will." This is asking us to evaluate the truth of the statement "If NOT Flu > Most, then Strep > Most".

Let's analyze this using the given premises. Premise 3 states that flu *likely* will infect the most. This means it's not *certain* that flu will infect the most, but it's the most probable outcome. However, the conditional statement in premise 2 is "If colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will." This is a nested conditional.

If flu *doesn't* infect the most, then we need to consider what happens according to premise 2. Premise 2 states that *if* colds don't infect the most, *then* if flu doesn't, strep will. Since we are considering the scenario where flu doesn't infect the most, we need to see if the condition "colds don't infect the most" is met.

Premise 3 states that flu *likely* will infect the most. This implies that colds likely won't. Therefore, it is likely that colds do *not* infect the most. Since the condition "colds don't infect the most" is likely to be true, and we are considering the scenario where flu doesn't infect the most, then according to premise 2, strep *will* infect the most.

Therefore, it follows that if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don’t win, then if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won’t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the given information and analyze the logical structure.

1. **Initial Probabilities:** Lakers are most likely to win, Warriors are second most likely, and Celtics have much lower odds. This establishes a hierarchy of likelihood.

2. **Conditional Statement 1:** "If the Warriors don’t win, then if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will win." This is a nested conditional statement. We can represent it as:  Warriors don't win -> (Lakers don't win -> Celtics win).

3. **Additional Information:** "It is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won’t win." This tells us that the probability of the Lakers winning is high, and consequently, the probability of the Warriors winning is low.

The question asks: "Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will?"

Let's analyze this. We know the Lakers are most likely to win. Therefore, the probability of the Lakers *not* winning is relatively low. However, we need to consider what happens *if* the Lakers don't win.

If the Lakers don't win, we have the conditional statement: Warriors don't win -> (Lakers don't win -> Celtics win). Since we are *assuming* the Lakers don't win, we are looking at the consequence of that assumption. The given information states that if the Warriors don't win, and the Lakers don't win, then the Celtics will win. We are given that it is most likely the Lakers will win, and hence that the Warriors won't win. So, if the Lakers don't win, then the Warriors won't win. Therefore, the condition of the nested conditional is met, and the Celtics will win.

Therefore, if the Lakers don't win, it follows that the Celtics will win.

QUESTION:
Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the argument step by step using logical notation to clarify the relationships.

Let:
* C = Coffee retains the most morning drinkers.
* T = Tea retains the most morning drinkers.
* S = Soda retains the most morning drinkers.

The given statements can be translated as follows:

1. "Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings." This implies C is likely true, T is likely true but less so than C, and S is unlikely.  We don't need to formalize this as a strict logical statement, as it's background information.

2. "If tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers." This can be written as: ¬T → (¬C → S).

3. "Coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers." This is equivalent to saying C is likely true.

We want to determine if it follows that "if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers," which is ¬C → S.

Let's analyze the argument. Statement 3 tells us that C is likely true. Therefore, ¬C is likely false.  Consider the conditional statement ¬T → (¬C → S).  Since we know C is likely true, ¬C is likely false.  Let's consider what happens if ¬C is false.  A conditional statement (p → q) is true whenever p is false. Therefore, ¬C → S is true, regardless of the truth value of S.

However, we are given ¬T → (¬C → S). Since C is likely true, ¬C is likely false. Therefore, the implication (¬C → S) is true regardless of the truth value of S. Thus, the entire implication ¬T → (¬C → S) is true if ¬T is false.

The question asks us to determine if ¬C → S follows. We know that C is likely true, so ¬C is likely false. Therefore, the implication ¬C → S is true regardless of the truth value of S.

However, the prompt asks if it *follows* that ¬C → S. The given information is:
1. ¬T → (¬C → S)
2. C is likely true.

Since C is likely true, ¬C is likely false. Therefore, the implication (¬C → S) is true regardless of the truth value of S. The implication ¬T → (¬C → S) is true if ¬T is false.

The question asks if ¬C → S follows. Since C is likely true, ¬C is likely false. Therefore, the implication (¬C → S) is true regardless of the truth value of S.

QUESTION:
Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren’t the top seller, then if banana bread isn’t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn’t the top seller, carrot cake will be?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements and analyze the logic.

1. **Initial Setup:** Banana bread (B), Chocolate Chip Cookies (C), Carrot Cake (K) are the top sellers.
2. **Initial Survey:** B is likely the top seller, followed closely by C, with K far behind.
3. **Conditional Statement 1:** "If chocolate chip cookies aren’t the top seller, then if banana bread isn’t, carrot cake will be."  This can be written as: If ¬C, then (If ¬B, then K).  Or, ¬C → (¬B → K).
4. **Additional Information:** "It is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won’t be." This means we have a high probability that B is the top seller and a high probability that C is *not* the top seller.  P(B) is high, and P(C) is low.

We want to determine if it follows that "if banana bread isn’t the top seller, carrot cake will be."  This can be written as: If ¬B, then K.  Or, ¬B → K.

Let's analyze the given information. We know ¬C → (¬B → K). We also know that it's likely that B is the top seller, so ¬B is unlikely.  Since ¬C is likely, we can substitute that into the conditional statement.  If ¬C is true, then ¬B → K must also be true.  However, we don't know if ¬C is true. We only know that it's *likely* that B is the top seller, which means ¬C is likely.

Let's consider the scenario where banana bread isn't the top seller (¬B).  The initial conditional statement says: If ¬C, then (¬B → K).  Since we are considering the case where ¬B is true, we need to see if we can conclude that K is true.  We know that ¬C → (¬B → K). If ¬B is true, then for the conditional to hold, K must be true. However, we don't know if ¬C is true.

Let's rephrase the question: Given that ¬C → (¬B → K) and P(B) is high, does it follow that ¬B → K?

Since P(B) is high, P(¬B) is low.  If ¬B is true, then, according to the conditional statement, we need ¬C to be true for K to be true.  However, we don't know if ¬C is true.  The initial survey says C is *closely* behind B, so it's possible C could be the top seller.

However, the question asks if it *follows* that if banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake will be. The given information states that if chocolate chip cookies aren't the top seller, then if banana bread isn't, carrot cake will be. Since it is likely that banana bread will be top, it is likely that chocolate chip cookies won't be. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn’t win, then if Spain doesn’t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won’t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn’t win, England will?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
Let's break down the given information and analyze the logical structure.

1. **Initial Probabilities:** Spain is most likely to win, followed by Brazil, then England. This establishes a hierarchy of likelihood.
2. **Conditional Statement:** "If Brazil doesn’t win, then if Spain doesn’t win, England will win." This is a nested conditional statement. We can represent it as: Brazil doesn't win -> (Spain doesn't win -> England wins).
3. **Likelihood of Spain Winning:** It is likely that Spain will win, which implies it is likely that Brazil won't win.

We want to determine if it follows that "if Spain doesn't win, England will." This is asking us to evaluate the truth of the statement "Spain doesn't win -> England wins".

Let's consider the nested conditional statement: Brazil doesn't win -> (Spain doesn't win -> England wins).  We are given that it's likely Spain will win, which means it's likely Brazil won't win.  If Brazil doesn't win, then the inner conditional (Spain doesn't win -> England wins) must be considered.

Since it's likely Spain *will* win, the probability of Spain *not* winning is relatively low. However, we are *not* told that Spain *definitely* will win. It's possible, albeit less likely, that Spain doesn't win.

If Spain doesn't win, then according to the given conditional statement, England *will* win.  Therefore, if Spain doesn't win, it follows that England will win.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it’s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will. Moreover, it’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the given information and analyze the logical implications.

1. **Initial Likelihoods:** Priya is most likely to get the role, followed by Julian, and Diego is a longshot. This establishes a hierarchy of probability: P(Priya) > P(Julian) > P(Diego).

2. **Conditional Statement 1:** "If Julian doesn’t get the offer, then if Priya doesn’t, Diego will." This can be represented as: If ¬Julian, then (If ¬Priya, then Diego).  This is a nested conditional. Let's unpack it. It means that if Julian isn't selected, then *if* Priya isn't selected, Diego *will* be selected.

3. **Further Information:** "It’s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won’t." This means P(Priya) is high, and therefore P(Julian) is low.  Since Priya is likely to get the role, Julian is unlikely to get it.

Now, let's consider the question: "Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn’t get the offer, Diego will?" We need to determine if P(Diego | ¬Priya) is high.

Since Priya is *likely* to get the offer, the probability of Priya *not* getting the offer (¬Priya) is relatively low. However, let's assume, for the sake of argument, that Priya doesn't get the offer.  The second part of the nested conditional states: If ¬Priya, then Diego.  Since we're *assuming* ¬Priya, then Diego *will* get the offer. The initial statement that Julian is second in line is irrelevant because Priya didn't get the offer.

Therefore, if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties.

These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the argument step by step using logical notation to clarify the relationships.

*   **Premise 1:** Democrats likely will gain the most new voters. (D)
*   **Premise 2:** Republicans likely will gain the most new voters. (R)
*   **Premise 3:** Libertarians likely will gain the most new voters, trailing distantly. (L)
*   **Premise 4:** If Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will. (¬R → (¬D → L))
*   **Premise 5:** Democrats likely will gain the most voters. (D)
*   **Premise 6:** Republicans likely won’t. (¬R)

We want to determine if it follows that if Democrats don't gain the most voters (¬D), then Libertarians will (L).  In other words, we want to know if ¬D → L is a valid conclusion.

From Premise 5 (D), we know that Democrats *do* gain the most voters. Therefore, ¬D is false.

Now, let's examine Premise 4: ¬R → (¬D → L). Since we know from Premise 6 that ¬R is true, we can apply Modus Ponens to the conditional statement. This means that (¬D → L) must be true.

However, we are given that Democrats likely *will* gain the most voters (Premise 5). This means ¬D is false.  A conditional statement (P → Q) is only false when P is true and Q is false. Since P (¬D) is false, the conditional statement (¬D → L) is automatically true, regardless of the truth value of L.

However, the question asks us to consider the scenario *if* Democrats don't gain the most voters. This is a hypothetical situation. We are given that Democrats *likely* will gain the most voters, but we are asked to consider what happens if that isn't the case.

If ¬D is true, then, according to Premise 4, ¬R → (¬D → L) becomes ¬R → L. Since we know ¬R is true (Republicans likely won't gain the most voters), then L must be true. Therefore, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements and analyze the logic.

1. **Initial Projection:** Taylor Swift (TS) likely sells the most, followed by Bad Bunny (BB), with Beyonce (B) far behind.
2. **Conditional Statement 1:** If BB doesn't sell the most, then if TS doesn't, B will.  We can represent this as: ¬BB → (¬TS → B)
3. **Additional Information:** TS likely will sell the most, and hence BB likely won't. This means ¬BB is likely true.

We want to determine if it follows that if TS doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will.  In other words, we want to know if ¬TS → B is necessarily true.

Since ¬BB is likely true (from the additional information), let's substitute that into Conditional Statement 1:
¬BB → (¬TS → B) becomes True → (¬TS → B).  This simplifies to ¬TS → B.

Therefore, based on the given information, it *does* follow that if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it’s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the argument step by step using logical notation to clarify the relationships.

*   **Premise 1:** Tidal power > Solar power > Wind power (in terms of electricity generation this year, where ">" means "generates more than") - This is based on the forecasts.
*   **Premise 2:** If solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will.  We can write this as: ¬Solar > Tidal > Wind.
*   **Premise 3:** Tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. This means Tidal > Solar.

We want to determine if it follows that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will.  This can be written as:  ¬Tidal > Wind.

Let's analyze the premises. Premise 3 tells us Tidal > Solar.  Premise 1 states the order is Tidal > Solar > Wind.  Since Tidal > Solar, and Solar > Wind, it follows that Tidal > Wind.

Now, let's consider the conditional statement in Premise 2: If ¬Solar > Tidal > Wind. This is equivalent to saying: If Solar does *not* generate the most electricity, then if Tidal does *not* generate the most electricity, then Wind will.

We are given that Tidal likely will generate the most electricity. Therefore, it is *not* the case that Tidal does *not* generate the most electricity.  Therefore, the antecedent of the conditional statement in Premise 2 is false.  A conditional statement is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Since the antecedent is false, the conditional statement is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent.

However, we are asked to determine if it *follows* that if Tidal doesn't generate the most electricity, then wind power will. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that Tidal does *not* generate the most electricity (¬Tidal).  If ¬Tidal, then according to Premise 2, if Tidal doesn't generate the most electricity, then wind power will. This is a direct consequence of the given conditional statement.

Therefore, if Tidal doesn't generate the most electricity, then wind power will.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the argument step by step.

1. **Premise 1:** India's economy is likely to grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. This establishes an initial ranking: India > China > Russia (where ">" means "growing faster than").

2. **Premise 2:** If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. This is a conditional statement. Let's represent it symbolically:  If (¬China_top) then (If (¬India_top) then Russia_top).

3. **Premise 3:** India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. This means India_top and ¬China_top.

We want to determine if it follows that if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy (¬India_top), then Russia will be (Russia_top).

Let's analyze this using the given premises.  Since premise 3 states India is *likely* the fastest, we can assume for the sake of the question that India *isn't* the fastest (¬India_top).

Now, let's look at premise 2: If (¬China_top) then (If (¬India_top) then Russia_top). We know from premise 3 that China isn't the top-growing economy (¬China_top). Therefore, the antecedent of the outer conditional is true. This means the consequent of the consequent must also be true. The consequent of the consequent is "If (¬India_top) then Russia_top". Since we are *assuming* ¬India_top, then Russia_top must be true.

Therefore, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be.

These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:  
We are told that Tennessee (T), Georgia (G), and Missouri (M) are the top three states for job growth. The relationships are as follows:  

1. **Conditional statement:** If Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will.  
   Symbolically: ¬G → (¬T → M).  

2. **Likely facts:** Tennessee likely will add the most jobs (so T is likely true), and hence Georgia likely won’t (so G is likely false).  

Given that G is likely false, the conditional ¬G → (¬T → M) becomes relevant. If ¬G is true, then the statement says that if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will.  

Now, since it’s *likely* that Tennessee *will* add the most jobs, the antecedent ¬T is unlikely. But the question asks whether it *follows that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will.*  

The key is that the conditional relationship (¬T → M) is embedded in the given information: it’s guaranteed under the assumption that Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs (which is likely). So even though Tennessee’s leading is likely, the conditional “if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will” is still likely true, because the structure of the given statements makes that conditional hold whenever Georgia doesn’t lead — and Georgia likely doesn’t.  

Therefore, it *does* follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will.

ERROR #2 (Question 14)

QUESTION:
Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:  
We are told that only one of three possible new laws will pass: a minimum wage hike (W), paid family leave (L), or student loan forgiveness (F). The probabilities are such that W is most likely, L is next, and F is least likely. The statement “if paid leave doesn’t happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn’t happen, loan forgiveness will happen” means that in the scenario where L does not occur, the only remaining possibilities are W or F, and if W also doesn’t occur, then F must occur.  

We are also told that a minimum wage hike likely will happen, and hence paid leave likely won’t happen. So the most probable world is one where W happens and L and F do not.  

The question asks whether it follows that it’s *likely* that, if a minimum wage hike doesn’t happen, loan forgiveness will. This is a conditional probability question: we’re asked about the likelihood of the conditional statement “if not W, then F.” Given the setup, the only alternative to W is F (since only one law can pass and L is unlikely). So, in the worlds where W doesn’t happen, F would indeed happen (because L is ruled out or very unlikely).  

However, the phrase “it’s likely that, if W doesn’t happen, F will” refers to the likelihood of that conditional being true, not the likelihood of F itself. Since the structure of the situation ensures that if W doesn’t happen, F must (because only one law can pass and L is ruled out), the conditional itself is very likely true.  

Therefore, yes—it follows that it’s likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn’t happen, loan forgiveness will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:  
Let’s restate the information logically.  

We have three markets:  
- S = stocks  
- R = real estate  
- B = bonds  

We’re told:  
1. Stocks likely will have the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds significantly lower.  
2. “If real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will.”  
   Symbolically: ¬R → (¬S → B).  
3. “Stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t.”  
   So it’s likely that S is true and ¬R is true.  

We’re asked: Does it follow that it’s *likely* that if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?  
That is, is it likely that (¬S → B)?  

From (2), we know that if ¬R holds, then (¬S → B) holds.  
Since it’s *likely* that ¬R (because stocks likely have the highest returns, not real estate), it’s *likely* that the condition ¬R is true.  
If ¬R is likely true, then the implication ¬R → (¬S → B) makes it likely that (¬S → B) holds.  

Therefore, given the premises, it *does* follow that it’s likely that if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:  
We are told that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the only major transportation providers. The data suggest Uber will likely have the most rides, Lyft second, and taxis significantly fewer. The statement “if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides” expresses a conditional relationship:  
- If Lyft is not the top provider, then in the hypothetical case that Uber also isn’t the top provider, taxis would be the top provider.  

We are also told that Uber likely will give the most rides, and therefore Lyft likely won’t. Given that Lyft likely won’t give the most rides, the antecedent of the conditional (“Lyft doesn’t give the most rides”) is likely true. If that antecedent is true, then the conditional tells us that in the hypothetical situation where Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis would.  

So, even though Uber is likely to give the most rides, the conditional relationship implies that *if* Uber doesn’t, taxis would. Since the conditional is given as true and Lyft likely won’t give the most rides, it follows that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:  
We are told that there are three illnesses—flu, cold, and strep—and that one of them will infect the most people. The doctors expect the flu to infect the most, followed by the cold, with strep lagging behind.  

We also have a conditional statement:  
- If colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will.  

Symbolically, let:  
- F = flu infects the most  
- C = cold infects the most  
- S = strep infects the most  

The conditional can be written as:  
¬C → (¬F → S).  

We are also told that flu likely will infect the most, and hence colds likely won’t. So it’s likely that ¬C is true.  

Given ¬C, the conditional simplifies to (¬F → S). That means: if flu doesn’t infect the most, then strep will.  

Since it’s likely that ¬C is true, it’s likely that the conditional (¬F → S) holds. Therefore, it *does* follow that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will.

These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:  
Let’s restate the information logically.  

We have three variables:  
- R = rents increase the most  
- H = home prices increase the most  
- M = mortgage rates increase the most  

We’re told:  
1. Economists project: R likely > H > M (in terms of increase).  
2. A conditional statement:  
   - If home prices don’t increase the most (¬H), then if rents don’t increase the most (¬R), mortgage rates will increase the most (M).  
   Symbolically: ¬H → (¬R → M).  
3. It’s also said that rents likely will increase the most (R likely true), and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most (¬H likely true).  

We’re asked: Does it follow that it’s *likely* that if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?  
That is, does it follow that (¬R → M) is likely?  

From (2), we know that if ¬H is true, then (¬R → M) must hold.  
From (3), we know ¬H is likely true.  
If ¬H is likely true, then the conditional (¬R → M) is likely true as well, because the truth of ¬H makes the implication (¬H → (¬R → M)) likely to apply.  

Therefore, given the premises, it *does* follow that it’s likely that if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:  
We are told that coffee, tea, and soda are the only major morning drinks. The statement “if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers” can be symbolized as:  
¬T → (¬C → S).  

We are also told that coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers (so C is likely true), and hence tea likely won’t (so ¬T is likely true).  

Given ¬T → (¬C → S), if ¬T is true (or likely true), then the conditional (¬C → S) follows. That means: if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will.  

Since ¬T is likely true, it’s likely that the conditional (¬C → S) holds. Therefore, it *does* follow that it’s likely that if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:  
We are told that there are three albums: Taylor Swift (T), Bad Bunny (B), and Beyoncé (Y). The experts project that T will likely sell the most, followed by B, with Y far behind. The logical condition given is:

Symbolically:  
¬B → (¬T → Y).

Now, the question asks whether it follows that it’s likely that *if T doesn’t sell the most, Y will*.  

Given that it’s likely ¬B, and the conditional ¬B → (¬T → Y) holds, we can infer that it’s likely that (¬T → Y) also holds, because if ¬B is likely true, then the inner conditional (¬T → Y) is likely true as well.

These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Popularity of Seasons**: Spring, summer, and winter are the top travel seasons.
2. **Forecast Order**: Most vacations are expected in spring, followed closely by summer, with significantly fewer in winter.
3. **Conditional Statement**: If summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will.

We need to determine whether it follows that "if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will."

- The statement "If summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will" can be interpreted as a nested conditional: 
  - If (Summer does not have the most vacations) → (If Spring does not have the most vacations, then Winter has the most vacations).

- We are also told that "spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't." This suggests that spring is more likely than summer to have the most vacations.

Now, let's analyze:

- If spring does not have the most vacations, we need to consider whether winter will have the most.
- According to the nested conditional, if summer doesn't have the most vacations (which it likely won't, since spring is expected to), then if spring doesn't, winter must have the most.

Thus, given that spring is more likely than summer to have the most vacations, and the condition states that if summer doesn't have the most, then if spring doesn't, winter will, it logically follows that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will indeed have the most.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the information given:

1. **Job Growth Ranking**: 
   - Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs.
   - Georgia is expected to be second in job growth.
   - Missouri has significantly lower job growth compared to Tennessee and Georgia.

2. **Conditional Statements**:
   - If Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will.
   - Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, implying that it's unlikely for Georgia or Missouri to surpass Tennessee in job additions.

3. **Logical Implications**:
   - Since Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, the scenario where Tennessee does not add the most jobs becomes less probable.
   - The statement "if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will" suggests a conditional relationship: If both Tennessee and Georgia do not lead in job growth, then Missouri must be leading.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that Tennessee is very likely to add the most jobs, the condition where Tennessee does not add the most jobs becomes unlikely.
   - However, if we consider the hypothetical scenario where Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, the given conditional statement directly implies that Missouri will then add the most jobs.

Therefore, based on the logical structure provided, it follows that if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, then Missouri will likely do so.

Let's break down the information given:

1. There are three possible new laws: 
   - Minimum Wage Hike (MW)
   - Paid Family Leave (PFL)
   - Student Loan Forgiveness (SLF)

2. The probabilities of these events happening, in order of likelihood, are:
   - MW is most probable.
   - PFL is less probable than MW but more probable than SLF.
   - SLF is the least likely.

3. Only one new law will be passed this session.

4. If PFL doesn't happen, then if MW doesn't happen, SLF must happen. This implies that if neither MW nor PFL happens, SLF is certain to occur because these are the only options available.

5. It's stated that a minimum wage hike (MW) likely will happen and hence paid leave (PFL) likely won't happen. This suggests that the probability of MW happening is high enough that it reduces the likelihood of PFL occurring.

Now, let's analyze the question: "Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?"

- We know from point 4 that if neither MW nor PFL happens, SLF must occur. This is a certainty given the constraints.
  
- The statement "a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen" suggests that MW has a high probability of occurring, which indirectly supports the idea that if MW doesn't happen, then PFL also not happening becomes more probable.

- If MW does not happen, according to point 4, SLF must occur because PFL is less likely than MW and only one law can be passed. Therefore, if MW doesn't happen, the remaining options are PFL or SLF, but since PFL is less likely than MW, it's more probable that SLF will happen.

Thus, given the constraints and probabilities, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness (SLF) will indeed occur. Therefore, it follows that it's likely that if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

Let's break down the information given:

1. The stock market is expected to see the highest returns, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns.
2. If real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will.
3. Stocks are likely to have the highest returns, so real estate won't.

We need to determine whether it follows that if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will.

- According to point 1, stocks are expected to have the highest returns. If they do not, then by elimination, either real estate or bonds must have the highest returns.
  
- Point 2 states: "If real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will." This is a conditional statement that implies:
  - If real estate does not have the highest returns (which it won't, according to point 3), and
  - If stocks do not have the highest returns,
  - Then bonds must have the highest returns.

- Point 3 confirms that stocks are likely to have the highest returns, so real estate will not. This aligns with the condition in point 2.

Given these points, if stocks don't have the highest returns, then by the logic provided (since real estate won't), bonds must have the highest returns.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won’t give the most rides. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Ridership Data**: 
   - Uber is expected to have the most rides.
   - Lyft follows with fewer rides than Uber.
   - Taxis have significantly fewer rides than both Uber and Lyft.

2. **Logical Implications**:
   - If Lyft doesn’t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides.
   - This can be expressed as: 
     \[
     (\neg L) \rightarrow ((\neg U) \rightarrow T)
     \]
     where \(L\) is "Lyft gives the most rides", \(U\) is "Uber gives the most rides", and \(T\) is "taxis give the most rides".

3. **Likelihoods**:
   - Uber likely will give the most rides, so it's unlikely that Uber doesn't give the most rides.
   - Consequently, Lyft likely won’t give the most rides.

4. **Analysis of the Conditional Statement**:
   - We need to determine if it’s likely that if Uber doesn’t give the most rides (\(\neg U\)), then taxis will give the most rides (\(T\)).
   - From the logical implication \((\neg L) \rightarrow ((\neg U) \rightarrow T)\), we know that if Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then the condition \((\neg U) \rightarrow T\) holds true.
   - Since Uber is likely to give the most rides, it's unlikely that \(\neg U\) occurs. However, if \(\neg U\) does occur, given that Lyft also likely won’t give the most rides (\(\neg L\)), the implication ensures that taxis will give the most rides.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The statement "if Uber doesn’t give the most rides, then taxis will" is supported by the logical structure provided.
   - Given the likelihoods and implications, it follows that if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis are likely to give the most rides due to the conditions set.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

Let's break down the information given:

1. The illnesses in question are flu, common cold, and strep throat.
2. Doctors expect the flu to infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections being the least prevalent.
3. If colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will.
4. It is likely that flu will infect the most, and hence it's unlikely that colds will.

We need to determine whether it follows that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will.

From point 3: If colds don't infect the most people (which they are expected not to), then if flu doesn't infect the most people, strep throat must be the one that does. This is a conditional statement indicating a direct relationship between flu and strep when colds do not have the highest infection rate.

From point 4: It's likely that flu will infect the most patients, which implies it's unlikely for either common cold or strep to surpass flu in terms of infections.

Now, consider the scenario where flu does not infect the most people. According to point 3, if this happens and given that colds are expected not to be the most prevalent (as per point 4), then by elimination, strep throat must be the one with the highest infection rate.

Therefore, based on the logical structure provided in the premises, it indeed follows that if flu doesn’t infect the most people, then it is likely that strep will. The conditions set up a clear chain of reasoning where flu not being the most prevalent directly leads to strep being the most prevalent when colds are already expected not to be.

QUESTION:
Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

Let's break down the information given:

1. Pizza is most likely to be the top takeout item, followed by burgers, with tacos being much less frequently ordered.
2. The statement "if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be" implies a conditional relationship:
   - If burgers are not first, and pizza is also not first, then tacos must be first.

3. It's stated that "pizza likely will lead takeout orders," which means it has a high probability of being the top item.
4. Consequently, "hence burgers likely won’t" suggests that if pizza leads, burgers do not, reinforcing the idea that pizza is more popular than burgers.

Now, we need to determine whether it follows that "if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be."

- If pizza is not first, then according to the initial condition, either burgers or tacos must be first.
- The statement implies that if both pizza and burgers are not first, tacos must be first.

Given that pizza is most likely to lead, the scenario where it doesn't leads us to consider the next possibilities: burgers or tacos. However, the conditional logic provided states that if pizza isn’t first and burgers aren’t either, then tacos will be first.

Thus, based on the given conditions, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, it is indeed likely (given the constraints) that tacos will be.

QUESTION:
Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

Let's break down the information given:

1. Coffee is expected to retain the most morning drinkers.
2. Tea is expected to be second in retaining morning drinkers.
3. Soda is consumed much less in the mornings.

The logical structure provided states:
- If tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.

We are also told that coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, which implies that tea won't retain the most morning drinkers. 

Given this setup, we need to determine whether it follows that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers.

Since coffee is expected to retain the most morning drinkers, the condition where coffee does not retain the most morning drinkers is a hypothetical scenario. However, according to the logical structure provided:

- If tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers (which it won't, because coffee retains the most), then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will indeed retain the most morning drinkers.

Thus, given that tea won't retain the most morning drinkers and the conditional statement is true, it logically follows that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.

Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren’t the top seller, then if banana bread isn’t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn’t the top seller, carrot cake will be?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

Let's break down the information given:

1. The most popular baked goods are banana bread (BB), chocolate chip cookies (CC), and carrot cake (CA).
2. It is very likely that BB will be the top seller.
3. If CC isn’t the top seller, then if BB isn’t, CA will be.
4. It is likely that BB will be top, hence it's unlikely that CC will be.

We need to determine whether it follows that it is likely that if BB isn’t the top seller, CA will be.

From point 3: If CC isn't the top seller, then if BB isn't either, CA must be. This implies a conditional relationship where if both BB and CC are not on top, CA has no competition for being the top seller among these three options.

Point 4 states that it is likely BB will be the top seller, which means there's a high probability of BB being at the top. Consequently, this reduces the likelihood of either CC or CA being the top seller when considering all possibilities.

Now, let’s consider the scenario where BB isn’t the top seller:

- If BB isn't on top and given that it is likely (from point 4), then we are left with two options: CC or CA.
- From point 3, if CC isn’t the top seller in this situation, then CA must be. 

Since it's very likely that BB will be the top seller, the probability of both BB and CC not being on top is low. However, given that scenario (BB not being on top), the condition from point 3 ensures that CA would indeed be the top seller if CC isn't.

Therefore, while the likelihood of BB not being the top seller is low, in such a case, it follows logically from the conditions provided that CA will be the top seller. Thus, given the structure of the argument and the conditions, it does follow that it is likely (in the context where BB isn’t on top) that CA will be.

These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the information given:

1. **Polling Prediction**: 
   - Democrats are predicted to gain the most new voters.
   - Republicans are expected to gain more than Libertarians but less than Democrats.

2. **Logical Implication**:
   - If Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will.

3. **Conclusion from Polling**: 
   - Since Democrats are likely to gain the most voters, it follows that Republicans won't gain the most voters.

Given these points:

- The statement "if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will" is a conditional statement.
- We know from polling that Republicans indeed do not gain the most voters because Democrats are predicted to.
- Therefore, we are in the situation described by the first part of the conditional: "Republicans don’t gain the most voters."

Now, according to the conditional statement, if this condition holds (which it does), then the second part must also hold: "if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will."

Thus, given that Republicans do not gain the most voters and the logical structure provided, it follows that if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the information given:

1. **Top-Selling Albums**: The top-selling albums are by Taylor Swift (T), Bad Bunny (B), and Beyoncé (Y).

2. **Sales Projections**:
   - It is likely that T sells the most copies.
   - B follows closely, but Y's sales are far behind.

3. **Logical Implications**:
   - If B doesn't sell the most, then if T doesn't sell the most, Y will.
   - Since it's likely that T sells the most, it implies that B is unlikely to sell the most.

4. **Conclusion**: 
   - We need to determine if it follows that it's likely that if T doesn't sell the most, Y will.

Given:
- If B doesn't sell the most (which is likely since T is expected to), then if T doesn't sell the most, Y must.
- Since it's likely that T sells the most, B not selling the most is a probable scenario.
- Therefore, in the scenario where T doesn't sell the most, the condition implies Y will.

Thus, it follows from the given conditions and logical implications that it is indeed likely that if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, Beyoncé's will.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

Let's break down the information given:

1. Economists project that India's economy is likely to grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia lagging behind.
2. The statement "if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be" implies a conditional relationship:
   - If China is not the top-growing (which it won't be since India is projected to grow fastest), then we consider the scenario where India also isn't the top-growing.
   - In that case, according to the statement, Russia must be the top-growing.

3. The additional information states that "India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't." This reinforces that India is projected to be the top-growing economy.

Now, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?

- The statement given ("if China is not the top-growing... then if India isn’t, Russia will be") directly addresses this scenario. It sets up a logical chain where:
  - If China is not the top (which we know it won't be), and
  - If India also isn't the top,
  - Then Russia must be the top.

Thus, based on the given conditions and logical structure, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, then according to the statement provided, Russia will indeed be the top-growing.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

Let's break down the information given:

1. Apples are most likely to be the top-selling fruit.
2. If apples aren't the top seller, then bananas won't be either (since it’s stated that if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be).
3. The statement "if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be" implies a conditional relationship: If apples are not the top seller and bananas are also not, then oranges must be.

Now, let's analyze the logical structure:

- We know that apples have the highest likelihood of being the top seller.
- The statement "if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be" can be interpreted as: If both apples and bananas are not the top sellers, then oranges must be.

Given this setup, we need to determine whether it is likely that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be. 

- The statement "it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be" suggests a strong likelihood of apples being on top, reducing the chance for bananas.
- If apples are not the top seller, then according to the conditional relationship provided, if bananas also aren't the top seller, oranges must be.

Thus, the condition "if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be" is directly supported by the given logical structure. The likelihood of this scenario hinges on the fact that if both apples and bananas are not at the top, then oranges have to be.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the information given:

1. Spring, summer, and winter are the top travel seasons.
2. Forecasts predict that spring is likely to have the most vacations this year, followed closely by summer, with many fewer in winter.
3. If summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring also doesn't, it implies that winter will (since these are stated as the only possible scenarios).
4. Additionally, it's suggested that spring likely has the most travelers, which would mean summer is less likely to be the top season.

Given this information, we need to determine whether it follows that it’s likely that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will.

From point 2, we know:
- Spring is predicted to have the most vacations.
- Summer is closely behind but still has fewer than spring.
- Winter has significantly fewer vacations compared to both spring and summer.

Point 3 directly states a conditional relationship: If summer does not have the most vacations AND spring also doesn't, then winter will. This means that if we eliminate summer as having the most vacations (and given it's closely behind spring), the only remaining option is winter.

Does it follow that it’s likely that, if thrillers aren’t #1, mysteries will be?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step.

1. Thrillers are expected to be the top-selling genre.
2. Romances are expected to come in second place.
3. Mysteries are far behind both thrillers and romances.
4. If romances aren't #1, then if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be #1.

The key points here involve conditional statements:
- If thrillers aren’t #1, then romances won’t be #1 (because thrillers are expected to be the top-selling genre).
- If romances aren’t #1 and thrillers aren’t #1, then mysteries must be #1.

Given these conditions, we can infer that if thrillers aren't at the top position:
- Romances cannot take the first place.
- Therefore, since thrillers are not in the first place and romances are also not in the first place, by process of elimination, mysteries will have to be in the first place.

QUESTION:
Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn’t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn’t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, Missouri will?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand the logical flow:

1. Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs.
2. Georgia is expected to add a significant number of jobs, second only to Tennessee.
3. Missouri’s job growth is significantly lower than both Tennessee and Georgia.

The key points are:
- If Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, then either Georgia or Missouri will (but not both).
- Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, which implies that Georgia likely won't.

Given these statements, we can infer:

- Since Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, it's unlikely that Tennessee won't add the most jobs.
- If Tennessee doesn’t add the most jobs, then by process of elimination and given the order of expectations (Tennessee > Georgia > Missouri), if Tennessee isn’t first, Missouri must be third.

QUESTION:
Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step:

1. There are three potential new laws: an increase in the minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness.
2. Only one of these will be passed this session.
3. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike to be most probable, followed by paid family leave, with student loan forgiveness being much less likely.
4. If paid family leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.
5. A minimum wage hike is likely to happen and hence paid family leave is unlikely to happen.

From point 4: "If paid family leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen." This can be written as:
- If ¬(paid family leave) and ¬(minimum wage hike), then (loan forgiveness).

From point 5: A minimum wage hike is likely to happen. This means that the probability of a minimum wage hike happening is high.

Given this information, let's analyze what happens if a minimum wage hike doesn't occur:
- If a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, and considering it is highly probable (likely) that a minimum wage hike will happen, then paid family leave is unlikely to happen.
- Since only one law can be passed, the remaining options are either paid family leave or loan forgiveness. Given that paid family leave is unlikely if a minimum wage hike doesn't occur, this leaves loan forgiveness as the most probable outcome.

Therefore, it follows that if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, then loan forgiveness will likely happen.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn’t have the highest returns, then if stocks don’t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if stocks don’t have the highest returns, bonds will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand the logical flow:

1. The stock market is expected to see the highest returns this year.
2. Real estate follows with the second-highest returns.
3. Bonds are expected to have significantly lower returns.

From these points, we can infer that if stocks do not have the highest returns, then real estate or bonds must take their place as having the highest returns. However, since real estate is expected to have higher returns than bonds, it means that if stocks don't top out in terms of return, bonds cannot be the highest return option.

Given this setup:
- If stocks do not have the highest returns (they could still be second or third), then real estate must take the top spot.
- Only if both stocks and real estate fail to provide the highest returns can bonds potentially become the best-performing investment.

The statement "if stocks don’t, bonds will" directly aligns with this reasoning. If stocks do not have the highest returns, it implies that either real estate or bonds are in first place. Since real estate is expected to perform better than bonds, if real estate does not take the top spot (which would be a surprise given its expected performance), then by process of elimination, bonds must.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if flu doesn’t infect the most, strep will?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the logic step by step.

1. The illnesses in question are ranked as follows:
   - Flu is expected to infect the most patients.
   - Common cold is next.
   - Strep throat is last.

2. If the flu doesn't infect the most people, then according to the given information, it must be that either the common cold or strep throat does so because these are the only major illnesses spreading and they cover all possibilities.

3. The statement "if colds don’t infect the most people, then if flu doesn’t, strep will" is a conditional statement. It means that if the flu doesn't infect the most (and thus it's not the case that the common cold does), then by elimination, strep must be the one to infect the most.

4. The additional information "flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won’t" further supports this logic because it reinforces that if the flu doesn't infect the most, the common cold also can't do so, leaving only strep as a possibility.

These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren’t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn’t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won’t. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if pizza isn’t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand their implications:

1. Pizza is expected to be the most frequently ordered food.
2. Burgers are next in line after pizza.
3. Tacos are ordered much less frequently than both pizza and burgers.

From these points, we can infer that if pizza isn't the top takeout item:
- Since pizza is still likely to be more popular than tacos (but not necessarily as much as burgers), it's unlikely that tacos will become the most popular.
- The statement suggests that if burgers aren’t the top takeout item, then tacos will be. However, this is conditional on the absence of both pizza and burgers being the top choice.

Given that:
- Pizza is likely to remain the top choice,
- If not, it implies a scenario where neither pizza nor burgers are at the top.
- In such a case, tacos would become the most popular due to their lower frequency compared to the other two options.

QUESTION:
Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand the logical flow:

1. Rents are expected to increase more than home prices and much more than mortgage rates.
2. If home prices do not increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.
3. It is likely that rents will increase the most, which implies it's unlikely that home prices will increase the most.

From statement 1, we know the order of expected increases: Rents > Home Prices > Mortgage Rates.

Statement 2 can be rephrased as:
- If Rents do not increase the most AND Home Prices do not increase the most, then Mortgage Rates will increase the most.
This is a conditional statement that links the outcomes for rents and home prices to mortgage rates increasing the most if both don't.

Statement 3 tells us it's likely that Rents will increase the most. This directly supports part of the condition in Statement 2 (Rents do not increase the most) being false, which means we need to focus on the scenario where Home Prices do not increase the most.

Given these points, if home prices don't increase the most and rents also don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will indeed increase the most according to statement 2. Since it's likely that rents will increase the most (and thus not the case that they won't), we are left with the scenario where home prices do not increase the most.

These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don’t win, then if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will win.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the information given:

1. The Lakers have the highest probability of winning.
2. The Warriors are next in line with a high probability of winning.
3. The Celtics have much lower odds compared to the Lakers and Warriors.

From this, we can infer:
- If the Lakers do not win, it is less likely that the Warriors will either (since they are second most likely).
- Therefore, if the Lakers don't win, the only remaining contender with significant probability of winning is the Celtics.

Given these points, let's analyze the statement: "Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don’t win, the Celtics will?"

The reasoning here hinges on the elimination process:
1. If the Lakers do not win (which has a high likelihood based on their position in the hierarchy of probabilities), then the Warriors are less likely to win.
2. With both the Lakers and the Warriors out of contention, the Celtics become the most probable winner.

Thus, if the Lakers don't win, it is indeed highly likely that the Celtics will because they are the only other team with significant probability left in the race.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand the logical flow:

1. Coffee is expected to retain the most morning drinkers.
2. Tea is next in line after coffee.
3. Soda is consumed much less than both coffee and tea in the mornings.

From these, we can infer:
- If coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then it must be either tea or soda that does so (since they are the only options).
- Given that tea likely won’t retain the most morning drinkers if coffee doesn't, this leaves soda as the only other option.

The key statement is: "If tea doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers."

This can be simplified to:
- If not (coffee retains), and not (tea retains), then soda retains.

Since we are given that it's likely coffee will retain the most morning drinkers, which implies tea won't. Therefore, if coffee doesn’t retain the most morning drinkers, by process of elimination, soda must.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step.

1. The best chances to win are for Spain, followed closely by Brazil, with much lower odds for England.
2. If Brazil does not win, and Spain does not win, then it is implied that England would win (since they have the only realistic chances left).
3. It's likely that Spain will win, which means there's a high probability that Brazil won't win.

Given these points, we need to determine if it follows that it is likely that, if Spain doesn’t win, England will.

- If Spain does not win, and considering the given odds, the only other realistic chance left would be for England.
- The statement "it's likely that Spain will win" implies a high probability of Spain winning. Therefore, there must also be a lower likelihood of Spain not winning (since these are the best chances).

Given this reasoning, if Spain does not win, then it is highly probable that England will win because Brazil’s odds are close to Spain's and they would likely take the opportunity.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand the logical flow:

1. Taylor Swift (TS) is projected to sell the most albums.
2. Bad Bunny (BB) is projected to come in second.
3. Beyonce (B) is far behind and expected to have a lower sales volume.

Given these projections, we can infer:
- If TS's album doesn't sell the most, then BB’s won’t either because he is projected to be second.
- Since BB’s album isn’t selling the most, B’s album must take the remaining position as it is far behind and thus has a higher chance of being third.

The statement we need to evaluate is: "Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?"

From our initial projections:
- If TS’s album sells the most (most likely), BB’s won’t.
- Therefore, if TS’s album does not sell the most, then BB’s must be in second place.

Since B is far behind and only comes into play when neither TS nor BB are leading, it follows that if TS doesn't lead, B will indeed take the third position.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand the logical flow:

1. Tidal power is forecasted to generate the most electricity this year.
2. Solar power follows tidal power in terms of generation capacity.
3. Wind power has significantly less capacity than both tidal and solar power.

From these, we can infer that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity:
- It could be because it's not generating as much as expected (which is unlikely given the forecast).
- Solar power would then have to generate more than its usual amount.
- If solar power also fails to generate the most, wind power will.

The key statement here is: "if tidal power doesn’t [generate the most electricity], if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then wind power will." This directly links the failure of both tidal and solar power to the likelihood of wind power generating the most.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand the logical flow.

1. Economists project that India is likely to grow the fastest among these three countries this year.
2. China’s growth rate is projected to follow closely behind India's.
3. Russia's growth rate is expected to be much lower than both India and China.
4. If China isn't the top-growing emerging economy, then by process of elimination (since India is likely to grow the fastest), it must be Russia.

Given these points, we can see that if India is not the top-growing economy, there are only two possibilities left: either China or Russia could be in second place. However, since China's growth rate is projected to follow closely behind India’s and is expected to be much faster than Russia's, it makes more sense for Russia to be the slower growing of the remaining options.

Therefore, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, then by elimination, Russia will likely be the next fastest grower.

ERROR #17 (Question 9)

QUESTION:
Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it’s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren’t the top seller, then if apples aren’t, oranges will be. Moreover, it’s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won’t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let's break down the statements to understand the logical flow.

1. Apples are expected to be the top-selling fruit.
2. Bananas are expected to be second in sales after apples.
3. Oranges are trailing distantly behind and are considered by far the top-selling fruits among these three.

The key points here are:
- If bananas aren't the top seller, then oranges will be (since they are the only other option left).
- It's likely that apples will be the top seller, which implies that bananas won't be the top seller because of their close second position to apples.

Given this information, if apples aren’t the top-selling fruit, it means that either bananas or oranges could potentially be in first place. However, since we know from the initial statements that bananas are expected to be just behind apples and thus likely not at the top, the only remaining option for being the top seller would be oranges.

Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:

Given three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.

The nested conditional "if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen" does NOT make "if X doesn't happen, Z will happen" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.

Example: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.

The inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has "much lower odds."

Critical reasoning about nested conditionals with probabilities:

Given three options X, Y, Z where P(X) > P(Y) > P(Z), if X doesn't occur, then Y becomes the most likely, NOT Z.

The nested conditional "if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen" does NOT make "if X doesn't happen, Z will happen" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.

Example: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.

The nested conditional "if X doesn't happen, then if Y doesn't happen, Z will happen" does NOT make "if X doesn't happen, Z will happen" likely. Why? Because when X is eliminated, Y still has higher probability than Z.

Example: If P(X)=0.50, P(Y)=0.35, P(Z)=0.15, then P(Z|not X) = 0.15/(0.35+0.15) = 0.30, which is not likely.

The inference only holds when Z's probability is close to Y's, which contradicts the premise that Z has "much lower odds."

Answer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.

QUESTION:
Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don’t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don’t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won’t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?

QUESTION:
Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny’s album doesn’t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift’s doesn’t, Beyonce’s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift’s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?

QUESTION:
Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it’s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn’t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn’t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?

QUESTION:
Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn’t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn’t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?

QUESTION:
Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don’t increase the most, then if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won’t increase the most. Does it follow that it’s likely that, if rents don’t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?
