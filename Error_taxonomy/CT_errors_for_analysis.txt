QUESTION:
From 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest', can we infer 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest'?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to determine if "If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest" can be inferred from "If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest."

Let me denote:
- G = the griffin was in the forest
- U = the unicorn was in the forest

The original statement is: G → U (If G then U)

The proposed inference is: ¬U → ¬G (If not U then not G)

This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That is, (G → U) ≡ (¬U → ¬G).

Therefore, yes, we can infer this.

yes

QUESTION:
From 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter', can we infer 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars'?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to determine if "If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars" can be inferred from "If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter."

Let me denote:
- A = "the alien visited Mars"
- R = "the robot visited Jupiter"

The original statement is: If A, then R (A → R)

The question asks if we can infer: If not R, then not A (¬R → ¬A)

This is asking whether we can infer the contrapositive of the original statement.

In classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That is:
(A → R) ≡ (¬R → ¬A)

Therefore, yes, we can infer "If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars" from the original statement.

QUESTION:
From 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', can we infer 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race?'

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to determine if "If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race" allows us to infer "If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race."

Let me denote:
- A = Alex finished the race
- C = Chris finished the race

The original statement is: If A, then C (A → C)

The proposed inference is: If not C, then not A (¬C → ¬A)

This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. If A → C is true, then ¬C → ¬A must also be true.

This is because:
- If A → C is true, then whenever A is true, C must be true
- Therefore, if C is false, A cannot be true (because if A were true, C would have to be true)
- So if C is false, A must be false

yes

QUESTION:
From 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', can we infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to determine if "If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake" can be inferred from "If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake."

Let me denote:
- V = the vampire was awake
- M = the mummy was awake

The original statement is: V → M (If V, then M)

The question asks if we can infer: ¬M → ¬V (If not M, then not V)

This is asking whether the contrapositive can be inferred from a conditional statement.

In classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The contrapositive of "V → M" is "¬M → ¬V".

Since they are logically equivalent, yes, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.

yes

QUESTION:
From 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside', can we infer 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside'?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement.

The original statement is: "If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside"
In logical form: If P, then Q (where P = "dog was inside" and Q = "cat was outside")

The proposed inference is: "If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside"
In logical form: If not Q, then not P

This is the definition of the contrapositive. A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.

Therefore, yes, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original conditional statement.

QUESTION:
From 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo', can we infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This question asks whether we can derive one conditional statement from another. Let me analyze the logical relationship.

The original statement is: "If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo"
In logical form: P → Q (where P = "Joe went to the park" and Q = "Lucy went to the zoo")

The proposed inference is: "If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park"
In logical form: ¬Q → ¬P (where ¬Q = "Lucy did not go to the zoo" and ¬P = "Joe did not go to the park")

This is a fundamental principle of logic called the **contrapositive**. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (P → Q) is logically equivalent to the original statement (¬Q → ¬P). This means they always have the same truth value.

If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. If the original statement is false, the contrapositive must also be false.

Therefore, yes, we can validly infer the second statement from the first.

Answer: yes

ANSWER GIVEN: yes
CORRECT ANSWER: no

QUESTION:
From 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', can we infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This question asks about the logical relationship between a conditional statement and its contrapositive.

The original statement is: "If the car was red, then the truck was blue"
In logical form: If P, then Q (where P = "car was red" and Q = "truck was blue")

The statement in question is: "If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red"
In logical form: If not Q, then not P

This is the definition of the contrapositive of a conditional statement. A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value.

If "If P, then Q" is true, then "If not Q, then not P" must also be true.

This can be verified through reasoning: If we know that whenever the car is red, the truck must be blue, then logically, if the truck is not blue, the car cannot have been red (otherwise the truck would have to be blue, which contradicts our observation).

In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this logical inference step by step.

The original statement is: "If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding."
In logical form: If P, then Q (where P = "Mary was at the wedding" and Q = "Sue was at the wedding")

The proposed inference is: "If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding."
In logical form: If not Q, then not P

This is asking whether we can infer the contrapositive of the original statement.

In formal logic, the contrapositive of "If P, then Q" is "If not Q, then not P." A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value.

To verify: If the original statement is true, then whenever P is true, Q must be true. This means if Q is false, P cannot be true (otherwise we'd have P true and Q false, contradicting the original statement). Therefore, if Q is false, P must be false.

This is a valid logical inference.

This is the contrapositive of the original statement. A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.

To verify: If we assume the original statement is true and the unicorn was NOT in the forest, then by modus tollens (the logical rule that allows us to infer "not P" from "not Q" when we have "If P then Q"), the griffin must NOT have been in the forest. This confirms the contrapositive is valid.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement.

Let me denote:
- P = "the alien visited Mars"
- Q = "the robot visited Jupiter"

The original statement is: "If P, then Q" (P → Q)

The statement we're asked about is: "If not Q, then not P" (¬Q → ¬P)

This is the definition of the contrapositive. A fundamental logical principle is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value.

In other words, if "If P then Q" is true, then "If not Q then not P" must also be true.

This is a valid inference rule in classical logic.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.

The original statement is: "If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake."
In logical form: If P, then Q (where P = vampire awake, Q = mummy awake)

The statement we're asked about is: "If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake."
In logical form: If not Q, then not P

This second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement. A fundamental principle of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent—they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.

To verify: If we assume the mummy was not awake, and we know that "if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake," then the vampire cannot have been awake (because if it were, the mummy would have to be awake, which contradicts our assumption). Therefore, the vampire was not awake.

QUESTION:
From 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside', can we infer 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside'?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: Let me work through this step-by-step using logical reasoning.

The original statement is: "If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside"
Let me represent this as: If D then C
Where D = "dog was inside" and C = "cat was outside"

The question asks if we can infer: "If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside"
This can be represented as: If not C, then not D

This is asking whether we can derive the contrapositive of the original statement.

In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement "If P then Q" is "If not Q then not P". A fundamental rule of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value.

So from "If D then C" we can validly infer "If not C then not D"

In plain English: If we know that "dog inside → cat outside" is true, then we can be certain that "cat NOT outside → dog NOT inside" is also true.

This is because if the cat was not outside, but the dog was inside, this would contradict our original rule (which states that the dog being inside necessitates the cat being outside).

Answer: yes

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement. Let me work through this step by step.

The original statement is: "If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry"
- Let P = "the cake was chocolate"
- Let Q = "the muffins were blueberry"
- Original form: P → Q (If P, then Q)

The proposed inference is: "If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate"
- This would be: ¬Q → ¬P (If not Q, then not P)

In classical logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement (P → Q) is (¬Q → ¬P), and the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This is a fundamental rule of inference.

To verify: 
- If P → Q is true, then whenever P is true, Q must be true
- This means if Q is false, P cannot be true (otherwise we'd have a contradiction)
- Therefore, ¬Q → ¬P must also be true

Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, we can validly infer it.

Answer: yes

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.

The original statement is: "If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo"
- Let P = "Joe went to the park"
- Let Q = "Lucy went to the zoo"
- Original form: If P, then Q (P → Q)

The question asks whether we can infer: "If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park"
- This would be: If not Q, then not P (¬Q → ¬P)

In classical logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of "If P, then Q" is "If not Q, then not P."

Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. They have the same truth value.

Therefore, from "If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo" we can validly infer "If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park."

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This question asks about a logical inference known as the contrapositive. Let me work through this step by step.

The original statement is: "If the car was red, then the truck was blue"
- Let P = "the car was red"
- Let Q = "the truck was blue"
- Original form: If P, then Q (P → Q)

The proposed inference is: "If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red"
- This translates to: If not Q, then not P (~Q → ~P)

In classical logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This is a fundamental rule of inference.

To see why this works:
- If P → Q is true, this means whenever P is true, Q must be true
- So if Q is false (not blue), then P cannot be true (because if P were true, Q would have to be true)
- Therefore, if Q is false, P must be false

The contrapositive (~Q → ~P) is logically equivalent to the original statement (P → Q), meaning they always have the same truth value.

Answer: yes

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement. Let me work through this step by step.

The original statement is: "If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den"
- Let P = "the bear was in the cave"
- Let Q = "the wolf was in the den"
- The statement has the form: If P, then Q (P → Q)

The proposed inference is: "If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave"
- This has the form: If not Q, then not P (¬Q → ¬P)

In classical logic, a conditional statement (P → Q) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (¬Q → ¬P). This is a fundamental logical principle.

To verify: 
- P → Q means "whenever P is true, Q must be true"
- ¬Q → ¬P means "whenever Q is false, P must be false"

These express the same logical relationship. If we know that P being true guarantees Q is true, then we also know that Q being false guarantees P is false (because if P were true, Q would have to be true, contradicting our assumption that Q is false).

Therefore, the contrapositive is a valid inference from the original conditional statement.

In this case, the contrapositive would be: "If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football"

A fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.

Therefore, from the original statement "If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball," we can validly infer "If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football."

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.

The original statement is: "If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding"
This can be written as: If M, then S (M → S)

The question asks whether we can infer: "If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding"
This can be written as: If not S, then not M (¬S → ¬M)

In classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The contrapositive of "If M, then S" is formed by:
1. Negating both the antecedent (M) and consequent (S)
2. Swapping their positions

So the contrapositive of (M → S) is (¬S → ¬M)

Since a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.

Therefore, from "If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding," we can validly infer "If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding."

QUESTION:
From 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', can we infer 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red'?

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This question asks about a logical inference pattern known as contraposition. Let me work through this step by step.

The original statement is: "If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow"
- Let P = "the apple was red"
- Let Q = "the banana was yellow"
- Original form: If P, then Q (P → Q)

The proposed inference is: "If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red"
- This translates to: If not Q, then not P (¬Q → ¬P)

In classical logic, contraposition is a valid inference rule. This means that a conditional statement (P → Q) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (¬Q → ¬P). They always have the same truth value.

To see why this works: If we assume P → Q is true, and we also assume the banana was not yellow (¬Q), then the apple could not have been red (¬P). Why? Because if the apple had been red (P), then by our original statement, the banana would have been yellow (Q), which contradicts our assumption that the banana was not yellow.

Therefore, the contrapositive is a valid logical inference from the original conditional statement.

Answer: yes

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.

The original statement is: "If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest."

In logical form: If G → U (where G = "griffin was in the forest" and U = "unicorn was in the forest")

The contrapositive of a conditional statement "If P then Q" is "If not Q then not P."

So the contrapositive of "If G → U" is "If not U → not G"

In words: "If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest."

A fundamental rule of logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must be true, and if one is false, the other must be false.

Therefore, from the original statement, we can validly infer its contrapositive.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of a conditional statement. Let me work through this step by step.

The original statement is: "If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter"
- Let P = "the alien visited Mars"
- Let Q = "the robot visited Jupiter"
- Original form: If P, then Q (P → Q)

The proposed inference is: "If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars"
- This translates to: If not Q, then not P (¬Q → ¬P)

In classical logic, a conditional statement (P → Q) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (¬Q → ¬P). This is a fundamental logical principle.

To verify: 
- P → Q means "whenever P is true, Q must be true"
- ¬Q → ¬P means "whenever Q is false, P must be false"

These express the same logical relationship. If we know that P being true guarantees Q is true, then we also know that Q being false guarantees P is false (because if P were true, Q would have to be true, contradicting our assumption that Q is false).

Therefore, the contrapositive is a valid inference from the original conditional statement.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.

The original statement is: "If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta"
This can be written in logical form as: If P, then Q

The contrapositive of a conditional statement "If P, then Q" is "If not Q, then not P"

A fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.

To see why this makes sense intuitively: If we know that Sue choosing pizza guarantees Bob chose pasta, then if Bob didn't choose pasta, Sue couldn't have chosen pizza (because if she had, Bob would have had to choose pasta according to our original rule).

Therefore, yes, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original statement.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.

The original statement is: "If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race"
- In logical form: If A, then C (A → C)

We're asked whether we can infer: "If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race"
- In logical form: If not C, then not A (¬C → ¬A)

In classical logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The contrapositive of "If A, then C" is formed by:
1. Negating both parts
2. Reversing their order

So the contrapositive of (A → C) is (¬C → ¬A).

Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.

Therefore, from "If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race," we can validly infer "If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race."

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.

The original statement is: "If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake."

In logical form: If V, then M (where V = vampire was awake, M = mummy was awake)

The contrapositive of a conditional statement "If P, then Q" is "If not Q, then not P."

For our statement:
- Original: If V, then M
- Contrapositive: If not M, then not V

In words: "If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake."

A fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent - they always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically about the contrapositive of a conditional statement.

The original statement is: "If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt"
- Let P = "Lisa bought the red shirt"
- Let Q = "Mark bought the blue shirt"
- Original form: If P, then Q (P → Q)

The question asks if we can infer: "If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt"
- This would be: If not Q, then not P (¬Q → ¬P)

In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement (P → Q) is (¬Q → ¬P), and the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means:
- If the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true
- If the original statement is false, the contrapositive must also be false

Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original statement.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: The original statement "If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding" can be represented logically as M → S, where M is "Mary was at the wedding" and S is "Sue was at the wedding." The question asks if we can infer "If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding," which is logically equivalent to ¬S → ¬M. In classical logic, an implication is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. The contrapositive of M → S is indeed ¬S → ¬M, and this equivalence holds because both statements have the same truth values in all scenarios. For example, if M → S is true, then whenever S is false (Sue was not at the wedding), M must also be false (Mary was not at the wedding) to avoid a contradiction. Thus, from the given implication, we can validly infer its contrapositive.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: The original statement "If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter" can be represented logically as P → Q, where P is "the alien visited Mars" and Q is "the robot visited Jupiter". The statement we are asked to infer is "If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars", which is ¬Q → ¬P. In logic, this is known as the contrapositive of the original implication. The contrapositive ¬Q → ¬P is logically equivalent to P → Q, meaning that if the original implication is true, the contrapositive must also be true. This is because if Q is false (¬Q is true), then for P → Q to hold, P must be false (¬P must be true). Therefore, from the given statement, we can validly infer the contrapositive.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: The given statement "If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis" is a conditional statement in logic, which can be represented as P → Q, where P is "Jeff played basketball" and Q is "Amy played tennis." In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P, which translates to "If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball." Since the contrapositive is always true if the original conditional is true, we can validly infer the second statement from the first. This is a fundamental principle in logic, ensuring that the truth of the original implication guarantees the truth of its contrapositive.

The statement we want to infer is "If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic". This can be represented as ~M -> ~P, where ~M is "the truck was not metal" and ~P is "the doll was not plastic".

The statement ~M -> ~P is the contrapositive of P -> M. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
The original statement is "If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball." This is a conditional statement of the form "If P, then Q," where P is "Tom watched football" and Q is "Jen watched basketball."

The statement "If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football" is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of "If P, then Q" is "If not Q, then not P."

A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.

Therefore, we can infer "If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football" from "If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball."

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation:
The original statement is a conditional statement of the form "If P, then Q," where P is "the dog was inside" and Q is "the cat was outside." We are asked if we can infer "If not Q, then not P." This is the contrapositive of the original statement.

A conditional statement "If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive "If not Q, then not P." This is a fundamental principle of logic. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.

Let's break it down with an example. Suppose the dog *was* inside. Then, according to the original statement, the cat *was* outside. Now, suppose the cat was *not* outside. This means the cat was inside. If the cat was inside, then the dog could not have been inside, because the original statement says if the dog was inside, the cat was outside. Therefore, if the cat was not outside, the dog was not inside.

Therefore, we *can* infer "If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside."

This is the contrapositive of the original statement. A fundamental principle of logic states that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. That is, if P -> Q is true, then ~Q -> ~P is also true.

Therefore, since we are given "If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal" (P -> Q), we *can* infer "If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic" (~Q -> ~P).

Explanation:  
The original statement is "If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside." In logical form, this can be written as:  
D → C  
(where D = "the dog was inside" and C = "the cat was outside").  

The contrapositive of a conditional statement "If P then Q" is "If not Q then not P." The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.  

So, the contrapositive of D → C is:  
¬C → ¬D

The question asks whether we can infer "If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta," which is \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \).

In logic, the statement \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) is known as the *contrapositive* of \( P \rightarrow Q \). A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent — they always have the same truth value. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.

Hence, we can indeed infer "If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta" from the given statement.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To determine if we can infer the given statement from the original one, let's analyze the logical structure. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form "If A, then B", where A is "the cake was chocolate" and B is "the muffins were blueberry". This type of statement is known as a material implication.

To infer "If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement "If A, then B" is "If not B, then not A". In this case, the contrapositive would be "If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate".

Since the original statement and its contrapositive have the same truth value (i.e., they are logically equivalent), we can conclude that if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To determine if we can infer the statement "If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red", let's analyze the given statement. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form "If A, then B". In this case, A is "the car was red" and B is "the truck was blue".

The inference we're trying to make is also a conditional statement of the form "If C, then D", where C is "the truck was not blue" and D is "the car was not red". To determine if this inference is valid, we need to check if the original statement implies the negation of B (i.e., "the truck was not blue") would imply the negation of A (i.e., "the car was not red").

In logic, this type of inference is known as a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement "If A, then B" is "If not B, then not A". In our case, the original statement implies that if the truck was blue (B), then the car was red (A). Therefore, it also implies that if the truck was not blue (not B), then the car was not red (not A).

In this case, "If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den" (A) implies "the wolf was in the den" (B). Since we are given that "the wolf was not in the den", we can apply modus tollens to conclude that "the bear was not in the cave".

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To make an inference from the given statement, we need to consider the logical structure of the conditional statement. The original statement is "If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim". This implies a relationship between the two statements, where if one is true, the other must also be true.

To infer "If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton", we need to consider the following:

* If the pants are not denim, it means they do not meet the condition of being denim.
* Since the original statement implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must also be denim, it follows that if the pants are not denim, the shirt cannot be cotton.

Therefore, we can infer that "If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton" is a logically consistent and valid conclusion based on the original statement.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To determine if we can infer the statement "If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football", we need to analyze the given conditional statement. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form "If A, then B". In this case, A is "Tom watched football" and B is "Jen watched basketball".

The converse of the original statement would be "If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football", which is not necessarily true based on the given information. However, to determine if we can infer the inverse statement "If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.

The contrapositive of a conditional statement "If A, then B" is "If not B, then not A". In this case, the contrapositive would be "If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football".

Since the original statement is "If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball", we can conclude that the contrapositive "If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football" is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement is also true.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This is an example of modus tollens, a logical rule that states if A implies B and it is known that B is false, then it must be true that A is false. In this case, "If the book was written by James" (A) implies "the book is a mystery novel" (B), and we know that the book is not a mystery novel. Therefore, using modus tollens, we can infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it must be true that the book was not written by James.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To determine if we can infer the statement "If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball", we need to analyze the given conditional statement. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form "If A, then B". In this case, A is "Jeff played basketball" and B is "Amy played tennis".

The inference we are asked about is also a conditional statement of the form "If not A, then not B", which is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.

In this case, the contrapositive would be "If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball". Since we know that the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can conclude that the inference is valid. Therefore, we can indeed infer the statement "If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball" from the original statement.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of inference that allows us to draw conclusions from conditional statements. The original statement "If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake" can be rewritten as "The vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake". From this, we can infer that if the mummy is not awake, it cannot be the case that the vampire is awake (because the implication does not hold). Therefore, we can conclude that "If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake".

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

The statement "If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside" is a conditional statement of the form \( P \rightarrow Q \), where:
- \( P \) is "the dog was inside"
- \( Q \) is "the cat was outside"

In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \( P \rightarrow Q \) is \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.

For our specific case:
- The contrapositive of "If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside" (\( P \rightarrow Q \)) would be "If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside" (\( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \)).

Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, from "If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside," we can indeed infer "If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside."

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

To determine whether we can infer "If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate" from "If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry," we need to analyze these statements using logical reasoning.

1. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form "If P, then Q," where:
   - P: The cake was chocolate.
   - Q: The muffins were blueberry.

2. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement "If P, then Q" is "If not Q, then not P." Importantly, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent; that is, they always have the same truth value.

3. Applying this to our original statement:
   - The contrapositive would be: "If the muffins were not blueberry (not Q), then the cake was not chocolate (not P)."

4. Since a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.

Therefore, based on logical equivalence between a statement and its contrapositive, we can conclude that "If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate" is a valid inference from "If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry."

QUESTION:
From 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo', can we infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: The statement "If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo" is a conditional statement of the form \( P \rightarrow Q \), where \( P \) represents "Joe went to the park" and \( Q \) represents "Lucy went to the zoo." In logic, this can be interpreted as: if \( P \) is true, then \( Q \) must also be true.

The statement we want to infer is "If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park," which is of the form \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \). This is known as the contrapositive of the original conditional statement. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent; that means if one is true, the other must also be true.

To see why this equivalence holds, consider the truth table for \( P \rightarrow Q \):

- If \( P \) is true and \( Q \) is true, then \( P \rightarrow Q \) is true.
- If \( P \) is true and \( Q \) is false, then \( P \rightarrow Q \) is false.
- If \( P \) is false and \( Q \) is true, then \( P \rightarrow Q \) is true.
- If \( P \) is false and \( Q \) is false, then \( P \rightarrow Q \) is true.

Now consider the contrapositive \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \):

- If \( Q \) is true and \( P \) is true, then \( \neg Q \) is false and \( \neg P \) is false, making \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) true.
- If \( Q \) is false and \( P \) is true, then \( \neg Q \) is true and \( \neg P \) is false, making \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) false.
- If \( Q \) is true and \( P \) is false, then \( \neg Q \) is false and \( \neg P \) is true, making \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) true.
- If \( Q \) is false and \( P \) is false, then \( \neg Q \) is true and \( \neg P \) is true, making \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) true.

The truth values for both the original statement and its contrapositive match in all cases. Therefore, we can infer that "If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park" is logically equivalent to the given statement.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

To determine if we can infer "If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red" from "If the car was red, then the truck was blue," we need to analyze these statements using logical reasoning.

1. The original statement is a conditional statement: "If the car was red (P), then the truck was blue (Q)." In symbolic logic, this can be written as \( P \rightarrow Q \).

2. We want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement holds true. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \( P \rightarrow Q \) is \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \), which translates to "If not Q, then not P."

3. In our case:
   - \( P \): The car was red.
   - \( Q \): The truck was blue.

4. The contrapositive of the original statement would be: "If the truck was not blue (\(\neg Q\)), then the car was not red (\(\neg P\))."

5. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if \( P \rightarrow Q \) is true, then \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) must also be true.

6. Therefore, given the original statement "If the car was red, then the truck was blue," we can indeed infer "If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red."

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

To determine whether we can infer "If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave" from "If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den," we need to analyze these statements using logical reasoning.

1. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form: If P, then Q.
   - Here, P is "the bear was in the cave."
   - Q is "the wolf was in the den."

2. We want to determine if the contrapositive of this statement can be inferred:
   - The contrapositive of "If P, then Q" is "If not Q, then not P."
   - In our case, it would be: If the wolf was not in the den (not Q), then the bear was not in the cave (not P).

3. A fundamental rule in logic states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value.

4. Therefore, if "If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den" is true, then its contrapositive "If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave" must also be true.

Based on this logical equivalence, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

To analyze this logical inference, let's break down the statements using propositional logic.

1. The original statement is "If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest." In symbolic terms, we can express this as:
   - \( G \rightarrow U \)
   where \( G \) represents "the griffin was in the forest" and \( U \) represents "the unicorn was in the forest."

2. We need to determine if we can infer "If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest." Symbolically, this is:
   - \( \neg U \rightarrow \neg G \)

3. The statement \( \neg U \rightarrow \neg G \) is known as the contrapositive of the original implication \( G \rightarrow U \). In logic, an implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.

4. Therefore, since \( G \rightarrow U \) is given to be true, its contrapositive \( \neg U \rightarrow \neg G \) must also be true.

The statement we want to infer is "If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James," which can be expressed as \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \).

In logic, \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) is known as the contrapositive of \( P \rightarrow Q \). The contrapositive of an implication is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if \( P \rightarrow Q \) is true, then its contrapositive \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) must also be true.

Therefore, from "If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel," we can indeed infer "If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James."

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

To determine whether we can infer "If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars" from "If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter," we need to analyze these statements using logical reasoning.

1. The original statement is a conditional statement: "If the alien visited Mars (P), then the robot visited Jupiter (Q)." This can be written in logical form as \( P \rightarrow Q \).

2. We want to determine if we can infer its contrapositive, which states: "If the robot did not visit Jupiter (\(\neg Q\)), then the alien did not visit Mars (\(\neg P\))." In logical terms, this is \(\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P\).

3. A fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement \( P \rightarrow Q \) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \(\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P\). This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.

4. Therefore, given "If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter" (\(P \rightarrow Q\)), we can indeed infer "If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars" (\(\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P\)) because they are logically equivalent statements.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

The statement "If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis" is a conditional statement of the form \( P \rightarrow Q \), where:
- \( P \) is "Jeff played basketball"
- \( Q \) is "Amy played tennis"

In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \( P \rightarrow Q \) is \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.

For our specific case:
- The original statement is: "If Jeff played basketball (\( P \)), then Amy played tennis (\( Q \))."
- The contrapositive of this statement would be: "If Amy did not play tennis (\( \neg Q \)), then Jeff did not play basketball (\( \neg P \))."

Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, we can indeed infer that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.

Explanation: 

The statement "If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta" is a conditional statement of the form \( P \rightarrow Q \), where:

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

To analyze this logical statement, let's break it down using propositional logic. The original statement is "If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race." In symbolic terms, we can express this as:

- Let \( A \) represent "Alex finished the race."
- Let \( C \) represent "Chris finished the race."

The given statement can be written in logical form as: 

\[ A \rightarrow C \]

We need to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this implication, which is "If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race." In symbolic terms, this would be:

\[ \neg C \rightarrow \neg A \]

In logic, an implication \( P \rightarrow Q \) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \). This means that if the original statement \( A \rightarrow C \) is true, then its contrapositive \( \neg C \rightarrow \neg A \) must also be true.

Therefore, from "If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race," we can indeed infer "If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race."

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: 

The statement "If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake" is a conditional statement of the form \( P \rightarrow Q \), where:
- \( P \) represents "the vampire was awake"
- \( Q \) represents "the mummy was awake"

This can be interpreted as: whenever \( P \) (vampire awake) is true, \( Q \) (mummy awake) must also be true.

We are asked to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is "If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake." The contrapositive of a conditional statement \( P \rightarrow Q \) is logically equivalent and takes the form \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \), where:
- \( \neg Q \) represents "the mummy was not awake"
- \( \neg P \) represents "the vampire was not awake"

In logic, a conditional statement \( P \rightarrow Q \) is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \). This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.

Therefore, given the truth of "If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake," we can indeed infer "If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake."

QUESTION:
From 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', can we infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: The statement "If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt" is a conditional statement of the form \( P \rightarrow Q \), where \( P \) is "Lisa bought the red shirt" and \( Q \) is "Mark bought the blue shirt." In logic, this can be expressed as: if \( P \) is true, then \( Q \) must also be true.

The statement we want to infer is "If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt," which is of the form \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \). This is known as the contrapositive of the original conditional statement. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent; that is, they always have the same truth value.

To see why this equivalence holds, consider the truth table for \( P \rightarrow Q \):

- If \( P \) is true and \( Q \) is true, then \( P \rightarrow Q \) is true.
- If \( P \) is true and \( Q \) is false, then \( P \rightarrow Q \) is false.
- If \( P \) is false and \( Q \) is true, then \( P \rightarrow Q \) is true.
- If \( P \) is false and \( Q \) is false, then \( P \rightarrow Q \) is true.

Now consider the contrapositive \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \):

- If \( Q \) is true and \( P \) is true, then \( \neg Q \) is false and \( \neg P \) is false, so \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) is true.
- If \( Q \) is false and \( P \) is true, then \( \neg Q \) is true and \( \neg P \) is false, so \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) is false.
- If \( Q \) is true and \( P \) is false, then \( \neg Q \) is false and \( \neg P \) is true, so \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) is true.
- If \( Q \) is false and \( P \) is false, then \( \neg Q \) is true and \( \neg P \) is true, so \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) is true.

As we can see from the truth tables, both \( P \rightarrow Q \) and its contrapositive \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \) have identical truth values in all possible scenarios. Therefore, if "If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt" is true, then "If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt" must also be true.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To determine if we can infer "If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside" from the statement "If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside," let's break down the logical structure.

The original statement is a conditional one: 
- If P (the dog was inside), then Q (the cat was outside).

This can be written as P → Q. 

To find out if we can infer another conditional from this, we need to consider the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both parts and switching their order: 
- If not Q (the cat was not outside), then not P (the dog was not inside).

The contrapositive of any valid conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.

Therefore, from "If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside," we can indeed infer "If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside."

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To determine if we can infer "If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate" from the given statement "If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry," we need to understand the logical structure of conditional statements and their contrapositives.

The original statement is in the form: 
- If P (the cake was chocolate), then Q (the muffins were blueberry).

In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement "If P, then Q" is "If not Q, then not P." Importantly, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.

The contrapositive of our original statement would be:
- If the muffins were not blueberry (not Q), then the cake was not chocolate (not P).

Since we know the given statement is in a form where its contrapositive can be directly inferred as logically equivalent, we can indeed infer "If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate."

This can be written as:
P → Q

To find out if we can infer the contrapositive, which would be:

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To determine if we can infer "If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red" from the given statement "If the car was red, then the truck was blue," we need to understand the logical structure of conditional statements and their contrapositives.

The original statement is in the form of a conditional:

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To solve this problem, let's break down the given statement and analyze its logical structure. The original statement is "If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train." This can be represented as:

P → Q

Where P stands for "Sam took a plane" and Q stands for "Erin took a train."

The question asks if we can infer "If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane," which translates to the contrapositive form of the original statement. The contrapositive of an implication (P → Q) is logically equivalent to the original statement and is formed by negating both parts and switching their order:

¬Q → ¬P

In our context:
- ¬Q means "Erin did not take a train"
- ¬P means "Sam did not take a plane"

The contrapositive of P → Q is always logically equivalent to the original implication. Therefore, if we know that "If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train" (P → Q) is true, its contrapositive ("If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane") must also be true.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To determine if we can infer "If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red" from the given statement "If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow," we need to understand the logical structure of conditional statements and their contrapositives.

The original statement is in the form of a conditional: "P → Q", where P stands for "the apple was red" and Q stands for "the banana was yellow." The contrapositive of this statement would be "¬Q → ¬P," which means "If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red."

In logic, a statement is equivalent to its contrapositive. Therefore, if we know that "If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow" (P → Q) is true, then by logical equivalence, "If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red" (¬Q → ¬P) must also be true.

Answer: yes

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To determine if we can infer "If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest" from the given statement "If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest," let's break down the logical structure.

The original statement is a conditional statement of the form: 
- If P (the griffin was in the forest), then Q (the unicorn was in the forest).

In logic, this can be written as:
P → Q

We need to determine if we can infer its contrapositive from this. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both parts and switching their order. So, for P → Q, the contrapositive would be:
¬Q → ¬P (If not Q, then not P)

In our context:
- ¬Q means "the unicorn was not in the forest"
- ¬P means "the griffin was not in the forest"

Thus, the contrapositive of the original statement is: 
"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest."

The key point here is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, if we accept the truth of the original statement, we can also accept the truth of its contrapositive.

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To solve this problem, let's break down the given statement and analyze its logical structure.

The original statement is "If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel." This can be represented in formal logic as:
P → Q,
where P stands for "the book was written by James" and Q stands for "the book is a mystery novel."

To determine if we can infer another statement from this, let's consider the contrapositive of the original implication. The contrapositive of an implication (P → Q) is logically equivalent to it and has the form:
¬Q → ¬P,
which translates in our context as "If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James."

The contrapositive can be derived from the original statement without any additional assumptions. It's a fundamental rule of logic that an implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To determine if we can infer "If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars" from the given statement "If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter," let's break down the logical structure.

The original statement is a conditional one: 
- If P (the alien visited Mars), then Q (the robot visited Jupiter).

In logic, this can be written as:
P → Q

We need to determine if we can infer another conditional from this:
¬Q → ¬P

This new conditional is the contrapositive of the original statement. In formal logic, a conditional and its contrapositive are logically equivalent; meaning that if one is true, the other must also be true.

Therefore, based on logical equivalence, "If the robot did not visit Jupiter (¬Q), then the alien did not visit Mars (¬P)" can indeed be inferred from the original statement.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To determine if we can infer "If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball" from the given statement "If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis," let's break down the logical structure.

The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of:
\[ P \rightarrow Q \]
where \( P \) represents "Jeff played basketball" and \( Q \) represents "Amy played tennis."

We need to determine if we can infer its contrapositive, which would be:
\[ \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \]

In logic, a conditional statement \( P \rightarrow Q \) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \). Therefore, the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To determine if we can infer "If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza" from the given statement "If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta," let's break it down step by step.

1. The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of "P → Q," where P stands for "Sue chose pizza" and Q stands for "Bob chose pasta." This means that if P (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then Q (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.
2. To find out what can be inferred from this statement, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original conditional statement. The contrapositive of a statement "P → Q" is logically equivalent and has the form "¬Q → ¬P," where ¬ denotes negation (not).
3. Applying this to our statement: The contrapositive of "If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta" would be "If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza."
4. It's important to note that the original statement does not provide any information about what happens if Bob chooses pasta or if Sue does not choose pizza; it only states a relationship between these two events.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To solve this problem, let's break down the given statement and analyze its logical structure.

The original statement is "If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake." This can be represented in logical terms as:
Vampire awake → Mummy awake

We need to determine if we can infer from this that "If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake," which translates to:
¬Mummy awake → ¬Vampire awake

To understand whether this inference is valid, let's consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (P → Q) is logically equivalent to it and can be formed by negating both parts and switching their order: ¬Q → ¬P.

Applying this to our original statement:
¬(Mummy awake) → ¬(Vampire awake)

This means that if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake. This is exactly what we need to infer from the given information.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Explanation: To solve this problem, let's break down the logical structure of the given statement and the inferred statement.

1. The original statement is a conditional one: "If Lisa bought the red shirt (L), then Mark bought the blue shirt (M)." This can be written as L → M.
2. We need to determine if we can infer from this that "If Mark did not buy the blue shirt (~M), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (~L)," which is represented as ~M → ~L.

In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement (P → Q) is (~Q → ~P). The contrapositive of a statement always has the same truth value as the original statement. Therefore, if L → M is true, then its contrapositive ~M → ~L must also be true.

QUESTION:
From 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', can we infer 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race?'

SYSTEM PROMPT:
In classical logic, (P → Q) is equivalent to (¬Q → ¬P). This is valid for the material conditional. However, natural language "if" is not a material conditional. It implies a connection or dependence between P and Q.

Therefore, the inference from "If P, then Q" to "If not Q, then not P" is INVALID for natural language.

Counterexample: "If it's raining, then it's not raining hard" can be true (light rain). But its contrapositive, "If it's raining hard, then it's not raining," is a contradiction and is always false.

Now apply this reasoning to the following question and answer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
I need to evaluate whether the contrapositive inference is valid in this case.

The statement is: "If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race"
The proposed inference is: "If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race"

This is asking about the contrapositive: (P → Q) to (¬Q → ¬P)

In this case, there appears to be a genuine conditional relationship - if Alex finishing implies Chris finishing, this suggests some dependency (perhaps Chris is faster, or they run together, or there's some causal connection).

Unlike the rain example I gave (which involved a contradiction), this statement describes a plausible conditional relationship where the contrapositive would hold: If Chris didn't finish, then Alex couldn't have finished either (since Alex finishing would have guaranteed Chris finishing).

This is a case where the contrapositive inference IS valid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION:
From 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', can we infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'?

SYSTEM PROMPT:
In classical logic, (P → Q) is equivalent to (¬Q → ¬P). This is valid for the material conditional. However, natural language "if" is not a material conditional. It implies a connection or dependence between P and Q.

Therefore, the inference from "If P, then Q" to "If not Q, then not P" is INVALID for natural language.

Counterexample: "If it's raining, then it's not raining hard" can be true (light rain). But its contrapositive, "If it's raining hard, then it's not raining," is a contradiction and is always false.

Now apply this reasoning to the following question and answer with only 'yes' or 'no' - nothing else.

MODEL RESPONSE:
yes
